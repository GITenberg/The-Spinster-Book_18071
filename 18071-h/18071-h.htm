<h2 style="color: red;">Notes on Men</h2>

<div class="sidenote">"The
Proper
Study"</div>


<p>If "the proper study of mankind is man,"
it is also the chief delight of woman. It
is not surprising that men are conceited, since
the thought of the entire population is centred
upon them.</p>

<p>Women are wont to consider man in general
as a simple creation. It is not until the
individual comes into the field of the feminine
telescope, and his peculiarities are thrown into
high relief, that he is seen and judged at his
true value.</p>

<p>When a girl once turns her attention from
the species to the individual, her parlour becomes
a sort of psychological laboratory in
which she conducts various experiments;
not, however, without the loss of friends.
For men are impatient of the spirit of inquiry
in woman.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Phenomena
of
Affection</div>

<p>How shall a girl acquire her knowledge of
the phenomena of affection, if men are not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
willing to be questioned upon the subject?
What is more natural than to seek wisdom
from the man a girl has just refused to marry?
Why should she not ask if he has ever loved
before, how long he has loved her, if he were
not surprised when he found it out, and how
he feels in her presence?</p>

<p>Yet a sensitive spinster is repeatedly astonished
at finding her lover transformed into
a fiend, without other provocation than this.
He accuses her of being "a heartless coquette,"
of having "led him on,"&mdash;whatever
that may mean,&mdash;and he does not care to have
her for his sister, or even for his friend.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Original
Research</div>

<p>Occasionally a charitable man will open his
heart for the benefit of the patient student. If
he is of a scientific turn of mind, with a fondness
for original research, he may even take a
melancholy pleasure in the analysis.</p>

<p>Thus she learns that he thought he had
loved, until he cared for her, but in the light
of the new passion he sees clearly that the
others were mere, idle flirtations. To her
surprise, she also discovers that he has loved
her a long time but has never dared to speak
of it before, and that this feeling, compared<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
with the others, is as wine unto water. In
her presence he is uplifted, exalted, and often
afraid, for very love of her.</p>

<p>Next to a proposal, the most interesting
thing in the world to a woman is this kind of
analysis. If a man is clever at it, he may
change a decided refusal to a timid promise to
"think about it." The man who hesitates
may be lost, but the woman who hesitates is
surely won.</p>

<p>In the beginning, the student is often perplexed
by the magnitude of the task which
lies before her. Later, she comes to know
that men, like cats, need only to be stroked
in the right direction. The problem thus becomes
a question of direction, which is seldom
as simple as it looks.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Personal
Equation</div>

<p>Yet men, as a class, are easier to understand
than women, because they are less emotional.
It is emotion which complicates the personal
equation with radicals and quadratics, and life
which proceeds upon predestined lines soon
becomes monotonous and loses its charm.
The involved <i>x</i> in the equation continually
postpones the definite result, which may
often be surmised, but never achieved.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p>Still, there is little doubt as to the proper
method, for some of the radicals must necessarily
appear in the result. Man's conceit is
his social foundation and when the vulnerable
spot is once found in the armour of Achilles,
the overthrow of the strenuous Greek is near
at hand.</p>

<p>There is nothing in the world as harmless
and as utterly joyous as man's conceit. The
woman who will not pander to it is ungracious
indeed.</p>

<p>Man's interest in himself is purely altruistic
and springs from an unselfish desire to please.
He values physical symmetry because one's
first impression of him is apt to be favourable.
Manly accomplishments and evidences of good
breeding are desirable for the same reason,
and he likes to think his way of doing things
is the best, regardless of actual effectiveness.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pencils</div>

<p>For instance, there seems to be no good
reason why a man's way of sharpening a pencil
is any better than a woman's. It is difficult
to see just why it is advisable to cover
the thumb with powdered graphite, and expose
that useful member to possible amputation
by a knife directed uncompromisingly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
toward it, when the pencil might be pointed
the other way, the risk of amputation avoided,
and the shavings and pulverised graphite left
safely to the action of gravitation and centrifugal
force. Yet the entire race of men refuse
to see the true value of the feminine method,
and, indeed, any man would rather sharpen
any woman's pencil than see her do it herself.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
"Supreme
Conceit"</div>

<p>It pleases a man very much to be told that
he "knows the world," even though his acquaintance
be limited to the flesh and the
devil&mdash;a gentleman, by the way, who is
much misunderstood and whose faults are
persistently exaggerated. But man's supreme
conceit is in regard to his personal appearance.
Let a single entry in a laboratory note-book
suffice for proof.</p>

<p><i>Time, evening. <span class="smcap">Man</span> is reading a story in
a current magazine to the <span class="smcap">Girl</span> he is calling
upon.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Man</span>. "Are you interested in this?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Girl</span>. "Certainly, but I can think of other
things too, can't I?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Man</span>. "That depends on the 'other things.'
What are they?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Girl</span>. (<i>Calmly.</i>) "I was just thinking that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
you are an extremely handsome man, but of
course you know that."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Man</span>. (<i>Crimsoning to his temples.</i>) "You
flatter me!" (<i>Resumes reading.</i>)</p>

<p>Girl. (<i>Awaits developments.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Man</span>. (<i>After a little.</i>) "I didn't know
you thought I was good-looking."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Girl</span>. (<i>Demurely.</i>) "Didn't you?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Man</span>. (<i>Clears his throat and continues the
story.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Man</span>. (<i>After a few minutes.</i>) "Did you
ever hear anybody else say that?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Girl</span>. "Say what?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Man</span>. "Why, that I was&mdash;that I was&mdash;well,
good-looking, you know?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Girl</span>. "Oh, yes! Lots of people!"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Man</span>. (<i>After reading half a page.</i>) "I
don't think this is so very interesting, do you?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Girl</span>. "No, it isn't. It doesn't carry out
the promise of its beginning."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Man</span>. (<i>Closes magazine and wanders aimlessly
toward the mirror in the mantel.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Man</span>. "Which way do you like my hair;
this way, or parted in the middle?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Girl</span>. "I don't know&mdash;this way, I guess.
I've never seen it parted in the middle."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Man</span>. (<i>Taking out pocket comb and rapidly
parting his hair in the middle.</i>) "There!
Which way do you like it?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Girl</span>. (<i>Judicially.</i>) "I don't know. It's
really a very hard question to decide."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Man</span>. (<i>Reminiscently.</i>) "I've gone off my
looks a good deal lately. I used to be a lot
better looking than I am now."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Girl</span>. (<i>Softly.</i>) "I'm glad I didn't know
you then."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Man</span>. (<i>In apparent astonishment.</i>) "Why?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Girl</span>. "Because I might not have been
heart whole, as I am now."</p>

<p>(<i>Long silence.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Man</span>. (<i>With sudden enthusiasm.</i>) "I'll
tell you, though, I really do look well in evening
dress."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Girl</span>. "I haven't a doubt of it, even
though I've never seen you wear it."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Man</span>. (<i>After brief meditation.</i>) "Let's
go and hear Melba next week, will you? I
meant to ask you when I first came in, but
we got to reading."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Girl</span>. "I shall be charmed."</p>

<p><i>Next day, <span class="smcap">Girl</span> gets a box of chocolates and a
dozen American Beauties&mdash;in February at that.</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Dimples
and Dress
Clothes</div>

<p>Tell a man he has a dimple and he will say
"where?" in pleased surprise, meanwhile
putting his finger straight into it. He has
studied that dimple in the mirror too many
times to be unmindful of its geography.</p>

<p>Let the woman dearest to a man say, tenderly:
"You were so handsome to-night,
dear&mdash;I was proud of you." See his face
light up with noble, unselfish joy, because he
has given such pleasure to others!</p>

<p>All the married men at evening receptions
have gone because they "look so well in
evening dress," and because "so few men
can wear dress clothes really well." In truth,
it does require distinction and grace of bearing,
if a man would not be mistaken for a
waiter.</p>

<p>Man's conceit is not love of himself but of
his fellow-men. The man who is in love with
himself need not fear that any woman will
ever become a serious rival. Not unfrequently,
when a man asks a woman to marry
him, he means that he wants her to help him
love himself, and if, blinded by her own feeling,
she takes him for her captain, her pleasure
craft becomes a pirate ship, the colours change<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
to a black flag with a sinister sign, and her
inevitable destiny is the coral reef.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Palmistry</div>

<p>Palmistry does very well for a beginning
if a man is inclined to be shy. It leads by
gentle and almost imperceptible degrees to
that most interesting of all subjects, himself,
and to that tactful comment, dearest of all to
the masculine heart; "You are not like other
men!"</p>

<p>A man will spend an entire evening, utterly
oblivious of the lapse of time, while a woman
subjects him to careful analysis. But sympathy,
rather than sarcasm, must be her guide&mdash;if
she wants him to come again. A man
will make a comrade of the woman who stimulates
him to higher achievement, but he will
love the one who makes herself a mirror for
his conceit.</p>

<p>Men claim that women cannot keep a secret,
but it is a common failing. A man will always
tell some one person the thing which is told
him in confidence. If he is married, he tells
his wife. Then the exclusive bit of news is
rapidly syndicated, and by gentle degrees, the
secret is diffused through the community.
This is the most pathetic thing in matrimony<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>&mdash;the
regularity with which husbands relate the
irregularities of their friends. Very little of
the world's woe is caused by silence, however
it may be in fiction and the drama.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Exchange
of
Confidence</div>

<p>In return for the generous confidence regarding
other people's doings, the married
man is made conversant with those things
which his wife deems it right and proper for
him to know. And he is not unhappy, for it
isn't what he doesn't know that troubles a
man, but what he knows he doesn't know.</p>

<p>The masculine nature is less capable of concealment
than the feminine. Where men are
frankly selfish, women are secretly so. Man's
vices are few and comprehensive; woman's
petty and innumerable. Any man who is not
in the penitentiary has at most but three or
four, while a woman will hide a dozen under
her social mask and defy detection.</p>

<p>Women are said to be fickle, but are they
more so than men? A man's ideal is as variable
as the wind. What he thinks is his ideal
of woman is usually a glorified image of the
last girl he happened to admire. The man
who has had a decided preference for blondes
all his life, finally installs a brown-eyed deity<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
at his hearthstone. If he has been fond of
petite and coquettish damsels, he marries some
Diana moulded on large lines and unconcerned
as to mice.</p>

<p>A man will ride, row, and swim with one
girl and marry another who is afraid of
horses, turns pale at the mention of a boat,
and who would look forward to an interview
with His Satanic Majesty with more
ease and confidence than to a dip in the summer
sea.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Portia
and
Carmen</div>

<p>Theoretically, men admire "reasonable
women," with the uncommon quality which
is called "common sense," but it is the
woman of caprice, the sweet, illogical despot
of a thousand moods, who is most often
and most tenderly loved. Man is by nature a
discoverer. It is not beauty which holds
him, but rather mystery and charm. To see
the one woman through all the changing
moods&mdash;to discern Portia through Carmen's
witchery&mdash;is the thing above all others
which captivates a man.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Dorcas
Ideal</div>

<p>Deep in his heart, man cherishes the Dorcas
ideal. The old, lingering notions of womanliness
are not quite dispelled, but in this, as in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
other things, nothing sickens a man of his
pet theory like seeing it in operation.</p>

<p>It may be a charming sight to behold a girl
stirring cheese in the chafing-dish, wearing
an air of deep concern when it "bunnies" at
the sides and requires still more skill. It may
also be attractive to see white fingers weave
wonders with fine linen and delicate silks,
with pretty eagerness as to shade and
stitch.</p>

<p>But in the after-years, when his divinity,
redolent of the kitchen, meets him at the door,
with hair dishevelled and fingers bandaged,
it is subtly different from the chafing-dish
days, and the crisp chops, generously black
with charcoal, are not as good as her rarebits
used to be. The memory of the silk and fine
linen also fades somewhat, in the presence of
darning which contains hard lumps and
patches which immediately come off.</p>

<p>It has become the fashion to speak of woman
as the eager hunter, and man as the
timid, reluctant prey. The comic papers may
have started it, but modern society certainly
lends colour to the pretty theory. It is frequently
attributed to Mr. Darwin, but he is at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
times unjustly blamed by those who do not
read his pleasing works.</p>

<p>The complexities in man's personal equation
are caused by variants of three emotions;
a mutable fondness for women, according
to temperament and opportunity, a more uniform
feeling toward money, and the universal,
devastating desire&mdash;the old, old passion for
food.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Key of
Happiness</div>

<p>The first variant is but partially under the
control of any particular woman, and the less
she concerns herself with the second, the better
it is for both, but she who stimulates and
satisfies the third variant holds in her hands
the golden key of happiness. No woman
need envy the Sphinx her wisdom if she has
learned the uses of silence and never asks a
favour of a hungry man.</p>

<p>A woman makes her chief mistake when
she judges a man by herself and attributes to
him indirection and complexity of motive.
When she wishes to attract a particular man,
she goes at it indirectly. She makes friends
of "his sisters, his cousins, and his aunts," and
assumes an interest in his chum. She ignores
him at first and thus arouses his curiosity.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
Later, she condescends to smile upon him and
he is mildly pleased, because he thinks he has
been working for that very smile and has
finally won it. In this manner he is lured
toward the net.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Wise
Virgin</div>

<p>When a girl systematically and effectively
feeds a man, she is leading trumps. He insensibly
associates her with his comfort and
thus she becomes his necessity. When a
man seeks a woman's society it is because he
has need of her, not because he thinks she
has need of him; and the parlour of the girl
who realises it, is the envy of every unattached
damsel on the street. If the wise one is an
expert with the chafing-dish, she may frequently
bag desirable game, while the foolish
virgins who have no alcohol in their lamps
are hunting eagerly for the trail.</p>

<p>Because she herself works indirectly, she
thinks he intends a tender look at another girl
for a carom shot, and frequently a far-sighted
maiden can see the evidences of a consuming
passion for herself in a man's devotion to
someone else.</p>

<p>Men are not sufficiently diplomatic to bother
with finesse of this kind. Other things being<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
equal, a man goes to see the girl he wants to
see. It does not often occur to her that he
may not want to see her, may be interested in
someone else, or that he may have forgotten
all about her.</p>

<div class="sidenote">"Encouragement"</div>

<p>There is a common feminine delusion to
the effect that men need "encouragement"
and there is no term which is more misused.
A fool may need "encouragement," but the
man who wants a girl will go after her, regardless
of obstacles. As for him, if he is fed
at her house, even irregularly, he may know
that she looks with favour upon his suit.</p>

<div class="sidenote">"Platonic
Friendship"</div>

<p>The parents of both, the neighbours, and
even the girl herself, usually know that a
man is in love before he finds it out. Sometimes
he has to be told. He has approached a
stage of acute and immediate peril when he
recognises what he calls "a platonic friendship."</p>

<p>Young men believe platonic friendship possible;
old men know better&mdash;but when one
man learns to profit by the experience of another,
we may look for mosquitoes at Christmas
and holly in June.</p>

<p>There is an exquisite danger attached to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
friendships of this kind, and is it not danger,
rather than variety, which is "the spice of
life?" Relieved of the presence of that social
pace-maker, the chaperone, the disciples of
Plato are wont to take long walks, and
further on, they spend whole days in the
country with book and wheel.</p>

<p>A book is a mysterious bond of union, and
by their taste in books do a man and woman
unerringly know each other. Two people
who unite in admiration of Browning are apt
to admire each other, and those who habitually
seek Emerson for new courage may easily
find the world more kindly if they face it
hand in hand.</p>

<p>A latter-day philosopher has remarked upon
the subtle sympathy produced by marked
passages. "The method is so easy and so
unsuspect. You have only to put faint pencil
marks against the tenderest passages in your
favourite new poet, and lend the volume to
Her, and She has only to leave here and there
the dropped violet of a timid, confirmatory
initial, for you to know your fate."</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
High-Priest</div>

<p>A man never has a platonic friendship with
a woman it is impossible for him to love.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
Cupid is the high-priest at these rites of reading
aloud and discussing everything under the
sun. The two become so closely bound that
one arrow strikes both, and often the happiest
marriages are those whose love has so begun,
for when the Great Passion dies, as it sometimes
does, sympathy and mutual understanding
may yield a generous measure of content.</p>

<p>The present happy era of fiction closes a
story abruptly at the altar or else begins it
immediately after the ceremony. Thence the
enthralled reader is conducted through rapture,
doubt, misunderstanding, indifference, complications,
recrimination, and estrangement to the
logical end in cynicism and the divorce court.</p>

<p>In the books which women write, the hero
of the story shoulders the blame, and often
has to bear his creator's vituperation in addition
to his other troubles. When a man
essays this theme in fiction, he shows clearly
that it is the woman's fault. When the situation
is presented outside of books, the happily
married critics distribute condemnation
in the same way, it being customary for each
partner in a happy marriage to claim the entire
credit for the mutual content.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Pursuit
and Possession</div>

<p>Over the afternoon tea cups it has been
decided with unusual and refreshing accord,
that "it is pursuit and not possession with a
man." True&mdash;but is it less true with women?</p>

<p>When Her Ladyship finally acquires the
sealskin coat on which she has long set her
heart, does she continue to scan the advertisements?
Does she still coddle him who hath
all power as to sealskin coats, with tempting
dishes and unusual smiles? Not unless she
wants something else.</p>

<p>Still, it is woman's tendency to make the
best of what she has, and man's to reach out
for what he has not. Man spends his life in
the effort to realise the ideals which, like will-o'-the-wisps,
hover just beyond him. Woman,
on the contrary, brings into her life what
grace she may, by idealising her reals.</p>

<p>In her secret heart, woman holds her unchanging
ideal of her own possible perfection.
Sometimes a man suspects this, and loves her
all the more for the sweet guardian angel
which is thus enthroned. Other men, less
fine, consider an ideal a sort of disease&mdash;and
they are usually a certain specific.</p>

<p>But, after all, men are as women make them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
Cleopatra and Helen of Troy swayed empires
and rocked thrones. There is no woman who
does not hold within her little hands some
man's achievement, some man's future, and
his belief in woman and God.</p>

<p>She may fire him with high ambition, exalt
him with noble striving, or make him a
coward and a thief. She may show him the
way to the gold of the world, or blind him
with tinsel which he may not keep. It is she
who leads him to the door of glory and so
thrills him with majestic purpose, that nothing
this side Heaven seems beyond his eager
reach.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Potter's
Hand</div>

<p>Upon his heart she may write ecstasy or
black despair. Through the long night she
may ever beckon, whispering courage, and
by her magic making victory of defeat. It is
for her to say whether his face shall be world-scarred
and weary, hiding tragedy behind its
piteous lines; whether there shall be light or
darkness in his soul. He cannot escape those
soft, compelling fingers; she is the arbiter of
his destiny&mdash;for like clay in the potter's hands,
she moulds him as she will.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2 style="color: red;">Concerning Women</h2>


<p>In order to be happy, a woman needs only a
good digestion, a satisfactory complexion,
and a lover. The first requirement being
met, the second is not difficult to obtain, and
the third follows as a matter of course.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Nagging</div>

<p>He was a wise philosopher who first considered
crime as disease, for women are
naturally sweet-tempered and charming. The
shrew and the scold are to be reformed only
by a physician, and as for nagging, is it not
allopathic scolding in homeopathic doses?</p>

<p>A well woman is usually a happy one, and
incidentally, those around her share her content.
The irritation produced by fifteen
minutes of nagging speaks volumes for the
personal influence which might be directed
the other way, and the desired result more
easily obtained.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Diversions</div>

<p>The sun around which woman revolves is
Love. Her whole life is spent in search of it,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
consciously or unconsciously. Incidental
diversions in the way of "career" and "independence"
are usually caused by domestic
unhappiness, or, in the case of spinsters, the
fear of it.</p>

<p>If all men were lovers, there would be no
"new woman" movement, no sociological
studies of "Woman in Business," no ponderous
analyses of "The Industrial Condition of
Women" in weighty journals. Still more
than a man, a woman needs a home, though
it be but the tiniest room.</p>

<p>Even the self-reliant woman of affairs who
battles bravely by day in the commercial arena
has her little nook, made dainty by feminine
touches, to which she gladly creeps at night.
Would it not be sweeter if it were shared by
one who would always love her? As truly
as she needs her bread and meat, woman
needs love, and, did he but know it, man
needs it too, though in lesser degree.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Verity
and the
Vision</div>

<p>Lacking the daily expression of it which is
the sweet unction of her hungry soul, she
seeks solace in an ideal world of her own
making. It is because the verity jars upon her
vision that she takes a melancholy view of life.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>One of woman's keenest pleasures is sorrow.
Her tears are not all pain. She goes
to the theatre, not to laugh, but to weep.
The clever playwright who closes his last
scene with a bitter parting is sure of a large
clientage, composed almost wholly of women.
Sad books are written by men, with an eye to
women readers, and women dearly love to
wear the willow in print.</p>

<p>Women are unconscious queens of tragedy.
Each one, in thought, plays to a sympathetic
but invisible audience. She lifts her daily
living to a plane of art, finding in fiction,
music, pictures, and the stage continual reminders
of her own experience.</p>

<p>Does her husband, distraught with business
cares, leave her hurriedly and without the
customary morning kiss? Woman, on her
way to market, rapidly reviews similar instances
in fiction, in which this first forgetting
proved to be "the little rift within the lute."</p>

<p>The pictures of distracted ladies, wild as to
hair and vision, are sold in photogravure by
countless thousands&mdash;to women. An attraction
on the boards which is rumoured to be
"so sad," leads woman to economise in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
matter of roasts and desserts that she may go
and enjoy an afternoon of misery. Girls
suffer all their lives long from being taken to
mirthful plays, or to vaudeville, which is unmixed
delight to a man and intolerably cheerful
to a woman.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Woman
and
Death</div>

<p>Woman and Death are close friends in art.
Opera is her greatest joy, because a great
many people are slaughtered in the course of
a single performance, and somebody usually
goes raving mad for love. When Melba sings
the mad scene from <i>Lucia</i>, and that beautiful
voice descends by lingering half-notes from
madness and nameless longing to love and
prayer, the women in the house sob in sheer
delight and clutch the hands of their companions
in an ecstasy of pain.</p>

<p>In proportion as women enjoy sorrow, men
shrink from it. A man cannot bear to be
continually reminded of the woman he has
loved and lost, while woman's dearest keepsakes
are old love letters and the shoes of a
little child. If the lover or the child is dead,
the treasures are never to be duplicated or replaced,
but if the pristine owner of the shoes
has grown to stalwart manhood and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
writer of the love letters is a tender and
devoted husband, the sorrowful interest is
merely mitigated. It is not by any means
lost.</p>

<div class="sidenote">"The
Eternal
Womanly"</div>

<p>Just why it should be considered sad to
marry one's lover and for a child to grow up,
can never be understood by men. There are
many things in the "eternal womanly" which
men understand about as well as a kitten
does the binomial theorem, but some mysteries
become simple enough when the leading
fact is grasped&mdash;that woman's song of life
is written in a minor key and that she actually
enjoys the semblance of sorrow. Still, the
average woman wishes to be idealised and
strongly objects to being understood.</p>

<div class="sidenote">"Tears,
Idle
Tears"</div>

<p>Woman's tears mean no more than the
sparks from an overcharged dynamo; they
are simply emotional relief. Married men
gradually come to realise it, and this is why a
suspicion of tears in his sweetheart's eyes
means infinitely more to a lover than a fit of
hysterics does to a husband.</p>

<p>We are wont to speak of woman's tenderness,
but there is no tenderness like that of a
man for the woman he loves when she is tired<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
or troubled, and the man who has learned
simply to love a woman at crucial moments,
and to postpone the inevitable idiotic questioning
till a more auspicious time, has in his
hands the talisman of domestic felicity.</p>

<p>If by any chance the lachrymal glands were
to be dried up, woman's life would lose a
goodly share of its charm. There is nothing
to cry on which compares with a man's
shoulder; almost any man will do at a critical
moment; but the clavicle of a lover is by
far the most desirable. If the flood is copious
and a collar or an immaculate shirt-front can
be spoiled, the scene acquires new and distinct
value. A pillow does very well, lacking
the shoulder, for many of the most attractive
women in fiction habitually cry into pillows&mdash;because
they have no lover, or because the
brute dislikes tears.</p>

<p>When grief strikes deep, a woman's eyes
are dry. Her soul shudders and there is a
hand upon her heart whose icy fingers clutch
at the inward fibre in a very real physical
pain. There are no tears for times like these;
the inner depths, bare and quivering, are
healed by no such balm as this.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>A sudden blow leaves a woman as cold as a
marble statue and absolutely dumb as to the
thing which lies upon her heart. When the
tears begin to flow, it means that resignation
and content will surely come. On the contrary,
when once or twice in a lifetime a
man is moved to tears, there is nothing so
terrible and so hopeless as his sobbing grief.</p>

<p>Married and unmarried women waste a
great deal of time in feeling sorry for each
other. It never occurs to a married woman
that a spinster may not care to take the troublous
step. An ideal lover in one's heart is
less strain upon the imagination than the
transfiguration of a man who goes around in
his shirt-sleeves and dispenses with his collar
at ninety degrees Fahrenheit.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Unknown
Country</div>

<p>If fiction dealt pleasantly with men who are
unmindful of small courtesies, the unknown
country beyond the altar would lose some of
its fear. If the way of an engaged girl lies
past a barber shop,&mdash;which very seldom has
a curtain, by the way,&mdash;and she happens to
think that she may some day behold her beloved
in the dangerous act of shaving himself,
it immediately hardens her heart. One<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
glimpse of one face covered with lather will
postpone one wedding-day five weeks. Many
a lover has attributed to caprice or coquetry
the fault which lies at the door of the "tonsorial
parlour."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Other
Feminine
Eyes</div>

<p>A woman may be a mystery to a man and
to herself, but never to another woman.
There is no concealment which is effectual
when other feminine eyes are fixed upon one's
small and harmless schemes. A glance at a
girl's dressing-table is sufficient for the intimate
friend&mdash;she does not need to ask questions;
and indeed, there are few situations in
life in which the necessity for direct questions
is not a confession of individual weakness.</p>

<p>If fourteen different kinds of creams and
emollients are within easy reach, the girl has
an admirer who is fond of out-door sports and
has not yet declared himself. If the curling
iron is kept hot, it is because he has looked
approval when her hair was waved. If there
is a box of rouge but half concealed, the girl
thinks the man is a fatuous idiot and hourly
expects a proposal.</p>

<p>If the various drugs are in the dental line,
the man is a cheerful soul with a tendency to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
be humorous. If she is particular as to small
details of scolding locks and eyebrows, he
probably wears glasses. If she devotes unusual
attention to her nails, the affair has
progressed to that interesting stage where he
may hold her hand for a few minutes at a
time.</p>

<p>If she selects her handkerchief with extreme
care,&mdash;one with an initial and a faint
odour of violet&mdash;she expects to give it to him
to carry and to forget to ask for it. If he
makes an extra call in order to return it, it
indicates a lesser degree of interest than if he
says nothing about it. The forgotten handkerchief
is an important straw with a girl
when love's capricious wind blows her way.</p>

<p>It is not entirely without reason that womankind
in general blames "the other woman"
for defection of any kind. Short-sighted
woman thinks it a mighty tribute to her own
charm to secure the passing interest of another's
rightful property. It does not seem
to occur to her that someone else will lure
him away from her with even more ease.
Each successive luring makes defection simpler
for a man. Practice tends towards<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
perfection in most things; perhaps it is the
single exception, love, which proves the rule.</p>

<p>Three delusions among women are widespread
and painful. Marriage is currently supposed
to reform a man, a rejected lover is heartbroken
for life, and, if "the other woman"
were only out of the way, he would come
back. Love sometimes reforms a man, but
marriage does not. The rejected lover suffers
for a brief period,&mdash;feminine philosophers
variously estimate it, but a week is a generous
average,&mdash;and he who will not come in spite of
"the other woman" is not worth having at all.</p>

<div class="sidenote">"Not
Things,
but Men"</div>

<p>Emerson says: "The things which are
really for thee gravitate to thee." One is
tempted to add the World's Congress motto&mdash;"Not
things, but men."</p>

<p>There is no virtue in women which men
cultivate so assiduously as forgiveness. They
make one think that it is very pretty and
charming to forgive. It is not hygienic,
however, for the woman who forgives easily
has a great deal of it to do. When pardon is
to be had for the asking, there are frequent
causes for its giving. This, of course, applies
to the interesting period before marriage.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Post-Nuptial
Sins</div>

<p>Post-nuptial sins are atoned for with gifts;
not more than once in a whole marriage with
the simple, manly words, "Forgive me,
dear, I was wrong." It injures a man's conceit
vitally to admit he has made a mistake.
This is gracious and knightly in the lover, but
a married man, the head of a family, must be
careful to maintain his position.</p>

<p>Cases of reformation by marriage are few
and far between, and men more often die of
wounded conceit than broken hearts. "Men
have died and worms have eaten them, but
not for love," save on the stage and in the
stories women cry over.</p>

<div class="sidenote">"The
Other
Woman"</div>

<p>"The other woman" is the chief bugbear
of life. On desert islands and in a very few
delightful books, her baneful presence is not.
The girl a man loves with all his heart can
see a long line of ghostly ancestors, and requires
no opera-glass to discern through the
mists of the future a procession of possible
posterity. It is for this reason that men's
ears are tried with the eternal, unchanging:
"Am I the only woman you ever loved?"
and "Will you always love me?"</p>

<p>The woman who finally acquires legal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
possession of a man is haunted by the shadowy
predecessors. If he is unwary enough to
let her know another girl has refused him, she
develops a violent hatred for this inoffensive
maiden. Is it because the cruel creature has
given pain to her lord? His gods are not her
gods&mdash;if he has adored another woman.</p>

<p>These two are mutually "other women,"
and the second one has the best of it, for there
is no thorn in feminine flesh like the rejected
lover who finds consolation elsewhere. It
may be exceedingly pleasant to be a man's
first love, but she is wise beyond books who
chooses to be his last, and it is foolish to
spend mental effort upon old flames, rather
than in watching for new ones, for C&aelig;sar
himself is not more utterly dead than a man's
dead love.</p>

<p>Women are commonly supposed to worry
about their age, but Father Time is a trouble
to men also. The girl of twenty thinks it
absurd for women to be concerned about the
matter, but the hour eventually comes when
she regards the subject with reverence akin to
awe. There is only one terror in it&mdash;the
dreadful nines.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Scylla
and
Charybdis</div>

<p>"Twenty-nine!" Might she not as well
be thirty? There is little choice between
Scylla and Charybdis. Twenty-nine is the
hour of reckoning for every woman, married,
engaged, or unattached.</p>

<p>The married woman felicitates herself
greatly, unless a tall daughter of nine or ten
walks abroad at her side. The engaged girl
is safe&mdash;she rejoices in the last hours of her
lingering girlhood and hems table linen with
more resignation. The unattached girl has a
strange interest in creams and hair tonics, and
usually betakes herself to the cloister of the
university for special courses, since azure
hosiery does not detract from woman's charm
in the eyes of the faculty.</p>

<p>Men do not often know their ages accurately
till after thirty. The gladsome heyday
of youth takes no note of the annual milestones.
But after thirty, ah me! "Yes," a
man will say sometimes, "I am thirty-one,
but the fellows tell me I don't look a day over
twenty-nine." Scylla and Charybdis again!</p>

<div class="sidenote">Perennial
Youth</div>

<p>Still, age is not a matter of birthdays, but
of the heart. Some women are mature
cynics at twenty, while a grey-haired matron<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
of fifty seems to have found the secret of
perennial youth. There is little to choose,
as regards beauty and charm, between the
young, unformed girl, whose soft eyes look
with longing into the unyielding future which
gives her no hint of its purposes, and the
mature woman, well-groomed, self-reliant
to her finger-tips, who has drunk deeply of
life's cup and found it sweet. A woman is
never old until the little finger of her glove
is allowed to project beyond the finger itself
and she orders her new photographs from
an old plate in preference to sitting again.</p>

<p>In all the seven ages of man, there is someone
whom she may attract. If she is twenty-five,
the boy who has just attained long
trousers will not buy her striped sticks of
peppermint and ask shyly if he may carry her
books. She is not apt to wear fraternity
pins and decorate her rooms in college colours,
unless her lover still holds his alma
mater in fond remembrance. But there are
others, always the others&mdash;and is it less
sweet to inspire the love which lasts than
the tender verses of a Sophomore? Her field
of action is not sensibly limited, for at twenty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
men love woman, at thirty a woman, and at
forty, women.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Three
Weapons</div>

<p>Woman has three weapons&mdash;flattery, food,
and flirtation, and only the last of these is
ever denied her by Time. With the first she
appeals to man's conceit, with the second to
his heart, which is suspected to lie at the
end of the &oelig;sophagus, rather than over
among lungs and ribs, and with the third
to his natural rivalry of his fellows. But
the pleasures of the chase grow beautifully
less when age brings rheumatism and kindred
ills.</p>

<p>Besides, may she not always be a chaperone?
When a political orator refers effectively
to "the cancer which is eating at the
heart of the body politic," someway, it
always makes a girl think of a chaperone.
She goes, ostensibly, to lend a decorous air
to whatever proceedings may be in view.
She is to keep the man from making love to
the girl. Whispers and tender hand clasps
are occasionally possible, however, for, tell
it not in Gath! the chaperone was once
young herself and at times looks the other
way.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p>That is, unless she is the girl's mother.
Trust a parent for keeping two eyes and
a pair of glasses on a girl! Trust the non-matchmaking
mother for four new eyes under
her back hair and a double row of ears arranged
laterally along her anxious spine!
And yet, if the estimable lady had not been
married herself, it is altogether likely that the
girl would never have thought of it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Chaperone</div>

<p>The reason usually given for chaperonage
is that it gives the girl a chance to become
acquainted with the man. Of course, in the
presence of a chaperone, a man says and does
exactly the same things he would if he were
alone with the maiden of his choice. He
does not mind making love to a girl in her
mother's presence. He does not even care
to be alone with her when he proposes to
her. He would like to have some chaperone
read his letters&mdash;he always writes with this
intention. At any time during the latter part
of the month it fills him with delight to see
the chaperone order a lobster after they have
all had oysters.</p>

<p>Nonsense! Why do not the leaders of society
say, frankly: "This chaperone business<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
is just a little game. Our husbands are either
at the club or soundly asleep at home. It is
not nice to go around alone, and it is pathetic
to go in pairs, with no man. We will go
with our daughters and their young friends,
for they have cavaliers enough and to spare.
Let us get out and see the world, lest we die
of ennui and neglect!" It is the chaperone
who really goes with the young man. She
takes the girl along to escape gossip.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Behold
his
House!</div>

<p>It is strange, when it is woman's avowed
object to make man happy, that she insists
upon doing it in her own way, rather than in
his. He likes the rich, warm colours; the deep
reds and dark greens. Behold his house!</p>

<p>Renaissance curtains obscure the landscape
with delicate tracery, and he realises what it
might mean to wear a veil. Soft tones of rose
and Nile green appear in his drawing-room.
Chippendale chairs, upon which he fears to
sit, invite the jaded soul to whatever repose
it can get. See the sofa cushions, which he
has learned by bitter experience never to touch!
Does he rouse a quiescent Nemesis by laying
his weary head upon that elaborate embroidery?
Not unless his memory is poor.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Home
Comforts</div>

<p>Take careful note of the bric-&agrave;-brac upon
his library table. See the few square inches
of blotting paper on a cylinder which he can
roll over his letter&mdash;the three stamps stuck
together more closely than brothers, generously
set aside for his use. Does he find
comfort here? Not very much of it.</p>

<p>See the dainty dinner which is set before
the hungry man. A cup of rarest china holds
four ounces of clear broth. A stick of bread
or two crackers are allotted to him. Then he
may have two croquettes, or one small chop,
when his soul is athirst for rare roast beef and
steak an inch thick. Then a nice salad, made
of three lettuce leaves and a suspicion of oil,
another cracker and a cubic inch of cheese, an
ounce of coffee in a miniature cup, and behold,
the man is fed!</p>

<p>Why should he go to his club, call loudly
for flesh-pots, sink into a chair he is not afraid
of breaking, and forget his trouble in the
evening paper, while his wife is at home,
alone, or having a Roman holiday as a chaperone?</p>

<p>It is a simple thing to acquire a lover, but it
is a fine art to keep him. Clubs were origin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>ally
intended for the homeless, as distinguished
from the unmarried. The rare woman
who rests and soothes a man when he is tired
has no rival in the club. Misunderstanding,
sorrowful, yearning for what she has lost,
woman contemplates the wreck of her girlish
dream.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Heart
of a
Woman</div>

<p>There are three things man is destined never
to solve&mdash;perpetual motion, the square of the
circle, and the heart of a woman. Yet he
may go a little way into the labyrinth with the
thread of love, which his Ariadne will gladly
give him at the door.</p>

<p>The dim chambers are fragrant with precious
things, for through the winding passages
Memory has strewn rue and lavender, love
and longing; sweet spikenard and instinctive
belief. Some day, when the heart aches, she
will brew content from these.</p>

<p>There are barriers which he may not pass,
secret treasures that he may not see, dreams
that he may not guess. There are dark
corners where there has been torture, of which
he will never know. There are shadows and
ghostly shapes which Penelope has hidden
with the fairest fabrics of her loom. There<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
are doors, tightly locked, which he has no key
to open; rooms which have contained costly
vessels, empty and deep with dust.</p>

<p>There is no other step than his, for he walks
there alone; sometimes to the music of dead
days and sometimes to the laughter of a little
child. The petals of crushed roses rustle at
his feet&mdash;his roses&mdash;in the inmost places of
her heart. And beyond, of spotless marble,
with the infinite calm of mountains and perpetual
snow, is something which he seldom
comprehends&mdash;her love of her own whiteness.</p>

<p>It is a wondrous thing. For it is so small
he could hold it in the hollow of his hand, yet
it is great enough to shelter him forever. All
the world may not break it if his love is steadfast
and unchanging, and loving him, it becomes
deep enough to love and pity all the
world.</p>

<p>It is a tender thing. So often is it wounded
that it cannot see another suffer, and its own
pain is easier far to bear. It makes a shield
of its very tenderness, gladly receiving the
stabs that were meant for him, forgiving
always, and forgetting when it may.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Solace</div>

<p>Yet, after all, it is a simple thing. For in
times of deepest doubt and trouble, it requires
for its solace only the tender look, the whispered
word which brings new courage, and
the old-time grace of the lover's way.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2 style="color: red;">The Philosophy of Love</h2>


<div class="sidenote">The
Prevailing
Theme</div>

<p>A modern novelist has greatly lamented
because the prevailing theme of fiction
is love. Every story is a love story, every
romance finds its inspiration in the heart, and
even the musty tomes of history are beset by
the little blind god.</p>

<p>One or two men have dared to write books
from which women have been excluded as
rigorously as from the Chinese stage, but the
world of readers has not loudly clamoured for
more of the same sort. A story of adventure
loses none of its interest if there is some fair
damsel to be rescued from various thrilling
situations.</p>

<p>The realists contend that a single isolated
fact should not be dwelt upon to the exclusion
of all other interests, that love plays but
a small part in the life of the average man or
woman, and that it is unreasonable to expand
it to the uttermost limits of art.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p>Strangely enough, the realists are all men.
If a woman ventures to write a book which
may fitly be classed under the head of realism,
the critics charitably unite upon insanity as
the cause of it and lament the lost womanliness
of a decadent generation.</p>

<p>If realism were actually real, we should
have no time for books and pictures. Our
days and nights would be spent in reclaiming
the people in the slums. There would be a
visible increase in the church fair&mdash;where we
spend more than we can afford for things we
do not want, in order to please people whom
we do not like, and to help heathen who are
happier than we are.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Root
of all
Good</div>

<p>The love of money is said to be the root of
all evil, but love itself is the root of all good,
for it is the very foundation of the social
structure. The universal race for the elusive
shilling, which is commonly considered selfish,
is based upon love.</p>

<p>Money will buy fine houses, but who would
wish to live in a mansion alone! Fast horses,
yachts, private cars, and the feasts of Lucullus,
are not to be enjoyed in solitude; they must
be shared. Buying jewels and costly raiment<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
is the purest philanthropy, for it gives pleasure
to others. Sapphires and real lace depreciate
rapidly in the cloister or the desert.</p>

<p>The envy which luxury sometimes creates
is also altruistic in character, for in its last analysis,
it is the wish to give pleasure to others,
in the same degree, as the envied fortunately
may. Nothing is happiness which is not
shared by at least one other, and nothing is
truly sorrow unless it is borne absolutely
alone.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Love</div>

<p>Love! The delight and the torment of the
world! The despair of philosophers and
sages, the rapture of poets, the confusion of
cynics, and the warrior's defeat!</p>

<p>Love! The bread and the wine of life, the
hunger and the thirst, the hurt and the healing,
the only wound which is cured by another!
The guest who comes like a thief in
the night! The eternal question which is its
own answer, the thing which has no beginning
and no end!</p>

<p>The very blindness of it is divine, for it sees
no imperfections, takes no reck of faults, and
concerns itself only with the hidden beauty
of the soul.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>It is unselfishness&mdash;yet it tolerates no rival
and demands all for itself. It is belief&mdash;and
yet it doubts. It is hope and it is also misgiving.
It is trust and distrust, the strongest
temptation and the power to withstand it;
woman's need and man's dream. It is his
enemy and his best friend, her weakness and
her strength; the roses and the thorns.</p>

<p>Woman's love affairs begin in her infancy,
with some childish play at sweethearts, and a
cavalier in dresses for her hero. It may be a
matter of affinity in later years, or, as the
more prosaic Buckle suggests, dependent
upon the price of corn, but at first it is certainly
a question of propinquity.</p>

<p>Through the kindergarten and the multiplication
table, the pretty game goes on. Before
she is thirteen, she decides to marry, and selects
an awkward boy a little older for the
happy man. She cherishes him in her secret
heart, and it does not matter in the least if
she does not know him well enough to speak
to him, for the good fairies who preside over
earthly destinies will undoubtedly lead The
Prince to become formally acquainted at the
proper time.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Self-Conscious
Period</div>

<p>Later, the self-conscious period approaches
and Mademoiselle becomes solicitous as to
ribbons and personal adornment. She pleads
earnestly for long gowns, and the first one is
never satisfying unless it drags. If she can
do her hair in a twist "just like mamma's,"
and see the adored one pass the house, while
she sits at the window with sewing or book,
she feels actually "grown up."</p>

<p>When she begins to read novels, her schoolmates,
for the time being, are cast aside, because
none of them are in the least like the
lovers who stalk through the highly-coloured
pages of the books she likes best. The hero
is usually "tall and dark, with a melancholy
cast of countenance," and there are fascinating
hints of some secret sorrow. The watchful
maternal parent is apt to confiscate these
interesting volumes, but there are always
school desks and safe places in the neighbourhood
of pillows, and a candle does not throw
its beams too far.</p>

<p>The books in which the love scenes are
most violent possess unfading charm. A
hero who says "darling" every time he
opens his finely-chiselled mouth is very near<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
perfection. That fondness lasts well into the after-years,
for "darling" is, above all others, the
favourite term of endearment with a woman.</p>

<p>Were it not for the stern parents and
wholesome laws as to age, girls might more
often marry their first loves. It is difficult to
conjecture what the state of civilisation might
be, if it were common for people to marry
their first loves, regardless of "age, colour,
or previous condition of servitude."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Age and
Colour</div>

<p>Age and colour are all-important factors
with Mademoiselle. She could not possibly
love a boy three weeks younger than herself,
and if her eyes are blue and her hair light, no
blondes need apply.</p>

<p>There is a curious delusion, fostered by
phrenologists and other amiable students of
"temperament," to the effect that a brunette
must infallibly fall in love with a blonde and
vice versa. What dire misfortune may result
if this rule is not followed can be only surmised,
for the phrenologists do not know.
Still, the majority of men are dark and it is
said they do not marry as readily as of yore&mdash;is
this the secret of the widespread havoc
made by peroxide of hydrogen?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>The lurid fiction fever soon runs its course
with Mademoiselle, if she is let alone, and she
turns her attention once more to her schoolmates.
She has at least a dozen serious attacks
before she is twenty, and at that ripe
age, is often a little <i>blas&eacute;</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Pastime
and
the Dream</div>

<p>But the day soon comes when the pretty
play is over and the soft eyes widen with
fear. She passes the dividing line between
childhood and womanhood when she first
realises that her pastime and her dream have
forged chains around her inmost soul. This,
then, is what life holds for her; it is ecstasy
or torture, and for this very thing she was
made.</p>

<p>Some man exists whom she will follow to
the end of the world, right royally if she may,
but on her knees if she must. The burning
sands of the desert will be as soft grass if he
walks beside her, his voice will make her forget
her thirst, and his touch upon her arm
will change her weariness into peace.</p>

<p>When he beckons she must answer. When
he says "come," she must not stay. She
must be all things to him&mdash;friend, comrade,
sweetheart, wife. When the infinite mean<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>ing
of her dream slowly dawns upon her, is it
strange that she trembles and grows pale?</p>

<p>Soon or late it comes to all. Sometimes
there is terror at the sudden meeting and Love
often comes in the guise of a friend. But
always, it brings joy which is sorrow, and pain
which is happiness&mdash;gladness which is never
content.</p>

<p>A woman wants a man to love her in the
way she loves him; a man wants a woman to
love him in the way he loves her, and because
the thing is impossible, neither is satisfied.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Strongest
Passion</div>

<p>Man's emotion is far stronger than woman's.
His feeling, when it is deep, is a
force which a woman may but dimly understand.
The strongest passion of a man's life
is his love for his sweetheart; woman's
greatest love is lavished upon her child.</p>

<p>"One is the lover and one is the loved."
Sometimes the positions are reversed, to the
misery of all concerned, but normally, man
is the lover. He wins love by pleading for it,
and there is no way by which a woman may
more surely lose it, for while woman's pity is
closely akin to Love, man's pity is a poor relation
who wears Love's cast-off clothes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>There are two other ways in which a woman
loses her lover. One is by marrying him and
the other by retaining him as her friend. If
she can keep him as her friend, she never believes
in his love, and husbands and lovers are
often two very different possessions.</p>

<p>A man's heart is an office desk, wherein
tender episodes are pigeon-holed for future
reference. If he is too busy to look them
over, they are carried off later in Father Time's
junk-wagon, like other and more profane
history.</p>

<p>All the isolated loves of a woman's life are
woven into a single continuous fabric. Love
itself is the thing she needs and the man who
offers it seldom matters much. Man loves
and worships woman, but woman loves love.
Were it not so, there would be no actor's photograph
upon the matin&eacute;e girl's dressing-table,
and no bit of tender verse would be fastened
to her cushion with a hat pin, while she herself
was fancy free.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Gift and
Giver</div>

<p>All her life long she confuses the gift with
the giver, and loving with the pride of being
loved, because her love is responsive rather
than original.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Forgotten
Harp</div>

<p>She demands that the lover's devotion shall
continue after marriage; that every look shall
be tender and every word adoring. Failing
this, she knows that love is dead. She is inevitably
disappointed in marriage, because she
is no longer his fear, intoxication, and pain,
but rather his comrade and friend. The vibrant
strings, struck from silence and dreams to a
sounding chord, are trembling still&mdash;whispering
lingering music to him who has forgotten
the harp.</p>

<p>When a woman once tells a man she loves
him, he regards it as some chemical process
which has taken place in her heart and he
never considers the possibility of change. He
is little concerned as to its expression, for
he knows it is there. On the contrary, it is
only by expression that a woman ever feels
certain of a man's love.</p>

<p>Doubt is the essential and constant quality
of her nature, when once she loves. She
continually demands new proof and new devotion,
consoling herself sometimes with the
thought that three days ago he said he loved
her and there has been no discord since.</p>

<p>As for him, if his comfort is assured, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
never thinks to question her, for men are as
blind as Love. If she seems glad to see him
and is not distinctly unpleasant, she may even
be a little preoccupied without arousing suspicion.
A man likes to feel that he is loved
and a woman likes to be told.</p>

<p>The use of any faculty exhausts it. The
ear, deafened by a cannon, is incapable for
the moment of hearing the human voice. The
eyes, momentarily blinded by the full glare
of the sun, miss the delicate shades of violet
and sapphire in the smoke from a wood fire.
We soon become accustomed to condiments
and perfume, and the same law applies to
sentiment and emotion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Lover's
Devotion</div>

<p>Thus it seems to women that men love
spasmodically&mdash;that the lover's devotion is a
series of unrelated acts based upon momentary
impulse, rather than a steady purpose. They
forget that the heart may need more rest than
the interval between beats.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Attraction
and
Repulsion</div>

<p>If a man and woman who truly loved each
other were cast away upon a desert island, he
would tire of her long before she wearied of
him. The sequence of attraction and repulsion,
the ultimate balance of positive and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
negative, are familiar electrical phenomena. Is
it unreasonable to suppose that the supreme
form of attraction is governed by the same
law?</p>

<p>Strong attractions frequently begin with
strong repulsions, sometimes mutual, but
more often on the part of the attracting force.
A man seldom develops a violent and inexplicable
hatred for a woman and later finds
that it has unaccountably changed to love.</p>

<p>Yet a woman often marries a man she has
sincerely hated, and the explanation is simple
enough, perhaps, for a woman never hates a
man unless he is in some sense her master.
Love and hate are kindred passions with a
woman and the depth of the one is the possible
measure of the other.</p>

<p>She is wise who fully understands her
weapon of coquetry. She will send her lover
from her at the moment his love is strongest,
and he will often seek her in vain. She will
be parsimonious with her letters and caresses
and thus keep her attraction at its height. If
he is forever unsatisfied, he will always be
her lover, for satiety must precede repulsion.</p>

<p>No woman need fear the effect of absence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
upon the man who honestly loves her. The
needle of the compass, regardless of intervening
seas, points forever toward the north.
Pitiful indeed is she who fails to be a magnet
and blindly becomes a chain.</p>

<p>The age has brought with it woman's desire
for equality, at least in the matter of love.
She wishes to be as free to seek a man as he
is to seek her&mdash;to love him as freely and
frankly as he does her. Why should she
withhold her lips after her heart has surrendered?
Why should she keep the pretence
of coyness long after she has been won?</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Old,
Old Law</div>

<p>Far beneath the tinsel of our restless age
lies the old, old law, and she who scorns it
does so at the peril of all she holds most dear.
Legislation may at times be disobeyed, but
never law, for the breaking brings swift punishment
of its own.</p>

<p>Too often a generous-hearted woman makes
the mistake of full revelation. She wishes
him to understand her every deed, her every
thought. Nothing is left to his imagination&mdash;the
innermost corners of her heart are laid
bare. Given the woman and the circumstances,
he would infallibly know her action.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
This is why the husbands of the "practical,"
the "methodical," and the "reasonable"
women may be tender and devoted, but are
never lovers after marriage.</p>

<p>If Alexander had been a woman, he would
not have sighed for more worlds to conquer&mdash;woman
asks but one. If his world had been
a clever woman he would have had no time
for alien planets, because a man will never
lose his interest in a woman while his conquest
is incomplete.</p>

<p>The woman who is most tenderly loved
and whose husband is still her lover, carefully
conceals from him the fact that she is fully
won. There is always something he has yet
to gain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Carmen
at Heart</div>

<p>After ten years of marriage, if the old relation
remains the same, it is because she is a
Carmen at heart. She is alluring, tempting,
cajoling and scorning in the same breath; at
once tender and commanding, inspiring both
love and fear, baffling and eluding even while
she is leading him on.</p>

<p>She gives him veiled hints of her real personality,
but he never penetrates her mask.
Could he see for an instant into the secret<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
depths of her soul, he would understand that
her concealment and her coquetry, her mystery
and her charm, are nothing but her love,
playing a desperate game against Time and
man's nature, for the dear stake of his own.</p>

<p>Dumas draws a fine distinction when he
says: "A man may have two passions but
never two loves: whoever has loved twice
has never loved at all." If this is true, the dividing
line is so exceedingly fine that it is beyond
woman's understanding, and it may be
surmised that even man does not fully realise
it until he is old and grey.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Cords
of
Memory</div>

<p>Yet somewhere, in every man's heart, is
hidden a woman's face. To that inner chamber
no other image ever finds its way. The
cords of memory which hold it are strong as
steel and as tender as the heart-fibre of which
they are made.</p>

<p>There is no time in his life when those eyes
would not thrill him and those lips make him
tremble&mdash;no hour when the sound of that
voice would not summon him like a trumpet-call.</p>

<p>No loyalty or allegiance is powerful enough
to smother it within his own heart, in spite of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
the conditions to which he may outwardly
conform. Other passions may temporarily
hide it even from his own sight, yet in reality
it is supreme, from the day of its birth to the
door of his grave.</p>

<p>He may be happily married, as the world
counts happiness, and She may be dead&mdash;but
never forgotten. No real love or hate is
wrought upon by Lethe. The thousand dreams
of her will send his blood in passionate flow
and the thousand memories of her whiten his
face with pain. Friendship is intermittent
and passion forgets, but man's single love is
eternal.</p>

<p>Because woman's love is responsive, it never
dies. Her love of love is everlasting. Some
threads in the fabric she has woven are like
shining silver; others are sombre, broken,
and stained with tears. When a man has
once taught a woman to believe his love is
true, she is already, though unconsciously,
won.</p>

<p>All the beauty in woman's life is forever
associated with her love. Violets bring the
memory of dead days, when the boy-lover
brought them to her in fragrant heaps. Some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
women say man's love is selfish, but there is
no one among them who has ever been loved
by a boy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Some
Lost Song</div>

<p>Broken, hesitant chords set some lost song
to singing in her heart. The break in her
lover's voice is like another, long ago. Summer
days and summer fields, silver streams,
and clouds of apple blossoms set against the
turquoise sky, bring back the Mays of childhood
and all the childish dreams.</p>

<p>This is another thing a man cannot understand&mdash;that
every little tenderness of his wakes
the memory of all past tenderness, and for
that very reason is often doubly sweet. This
is the explanation of sudden sadness, of the
swift succession of moods, and of lips, shut
on sobs, that sometimes quiver beneath his
own.</p>

<p>Woman keeps alive the old ideals. Were
it not for her eager efforts, chivalry would
have died long ago. King Arthur's Court is
said to be a myth, and Lancelot and Guenevere
were only dreams, but the knightly spirit
still lives in man's love for woman.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Lady
of the
Court</div>

<p>The Lady of the Court was wont to send
her knight into danger at her sweet, capricious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
will. Her glove upon his helmet, her scarf
upon his arm, her colours on his shield&mdash;were
they worth the risk of horse and spear? Yet
the little that she gave him, made him invincible
in the field.</p>

<p>To-day there is a subtle change. She is
loved as dearly as was Guenevere, but she
gives him neither scarf nor glove. Her love in
his heart is truly his shield and his colours are
the white of her soul.</p>

<p>He needs no gage but her belief, and having
that, it is a trust only a coward will betray.
The battle is still to the strong, but just as surely
her knight comes back with his shield untarnished,
his colours unstained, and his heart
aglow with love of her who gave him courage.</p>

<p>The centuries have brought new striving,
which the Lady of the Court could never
know. The daughter of to-day endeavours
to be worthy of the knightly worship&mdash;to be
royal in her heart and queenly in her giving;
to be the exquisitely womanly woman he sees
behind her faulty clay, so that if the veil of
illusion he has woven around her should ever
fall away, the reality might be even fairer
than his dream.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p>Through the sombre pages of history the
knights and ladies move, as though woven in
the magic web of the Lady of Shalott.
Tournament and shield and spear, the Round
Table and Camelot, have taken on the mystery
of fables and dreams.</p>

<div class="sidenote">By Grace
of Magic</div>

<p>Yet, by the grace of magic, the sweet old
story lives to-day, unforgotten, because of its
single motive. Elaine still dies for love of
Lancelot, Isolde urges Tristram to new proofs
of devotion, and Guenevere, the beautiful,
still shares King Arthur's throne. For chivalry
is not dead&mdash;- it only sleeps&mdash;and the
nobleness and valour of that far-off time are
ever at the service of her who has found her
knight.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<h2 style="color: red;">The Lost Art of Courtship</h2>


<div class="sidenote">Liberty of
Choice</div>

<p>Civilisation is so acutely developed at
present that the old meaning of courtship
is completely lost. None of the phenomena
which precede a proposal would be
deemed singular or out of place in a platonic
friendship. This state of affairs gives a man
every advantage and all possible liberty of
choice.</p>

<p>Our grandparents are scandalised at modern
methods. "Girls never did so," in the
distant years when those dear people were
young. If a young man called on grandmother
once a week, and she approved of
him and his prospects, she began on her household
linen, without waiting for the momentous
question.</p>

<p>Judging by the fiction of the period and
by the delightful tales of old New England,
which read like fairy stories to this generation,
the courtships of those days were too leisurely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
to be very interesting. Ten-year engagements
did not seem to be unusual, and it was
not considered a social mistake if a man
suddenly disappeared for four or five years,
without the formality of mentioning his
destination to the young woman who expected
to marry him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Faithful
Maidens</div>

<p>We have all read of the faithful maidens
who kept on weaving stores of fine linen
and making regular pilgrimages for the letter
which did not come. Years afterward, when
the man finally appeared, it was all right, and
the wedding went on just the same, even
though in the meantime the recreant knight
had married and been bereaved.</p>

<p>Two or three homeless children were sometimes
brought cheerfully into the story, and
assisted materially in the continuation of the
interrupted courtship. The tears which the
modern spinster sheds over such a tale are
not at the pathos of the situation, but because
it is possible, even in fiction, for a woman
to be so destitute of spirit.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Without
Saying a
Word</div>

<p>"In dem days," as Uncle Remus would
say, any attention whatever meant business.
Small courtesies which are without signifi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>cance
now were fraught with momentous
import then. In this year of grace, among
all races except our own, there are ways in
which a man may definitely commit himself
without saying a word.</p>

<p>A flower or a serenade is almost equivalent
to a proposal in sunny Spain. A "walking-out"
period of six months is much in vogue
in other parts of Europe, but the daughter
of the Anglo-Saxon has no such guide to a
man's intentions.</p>

<p>Among certain savage tribes, if a man is
in love with a girl and wishes to marry her,
he drags her around his tent by the hair or
administers a severe beating. It may be surmised
that these attentions are not altogether
pleasant, but she has the advantage of knowing
what the man means.</p>

<p>Flowers are a pretty courtesy and nothing
more. The kindly thought which prompts
them may be as transient as their bloom.
Three or four men serenade girls on summer
nights because they love to hear themselves
sing. Books, and music, and sweets, which
convention decrees are the only proper gifts
for the unattached, may be sent to any girl,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
without affecting her indifference to furniture
advertisements and January sales of linen.</p>

<p>If there is any actual courtship at the present
time, the girl does just as much of it as
the man. Her dainty remembrances at holiday
time have little more meaning than the
trifles a man bestows upon her, though the
gift latitude accorded her is much wider in
scope.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Furniture</div>

<p>When a girl gives a man furniture, she
usually intends to marry him, but often
merely succeeds in making things interesting
for the girl who does it in spite of her. The
newly-married woman attends to the personal
belongings of her happy possessor with
the celerity which is taught in classes for
"First Aid to the Injured."</p>

<p>One by one, the cherished souvenirs of his
bachelor days disappear. Pictures painted by
rival fair ones go to adorn the servant's room,
through gradual retirement backward. Rare
china is mysteriously broken. Sofa cushions
never "harmonise with the tone of the room,"
and the covers have to be changed. It takes
time, but usually by the first anniversary of a
man's marriage, his penates have been nobly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
weeded out, and the things he has left are of
his wife's choosing, generously purchased
with his own money.</p>

<p>Woe to the girl who gives a man a scarf-pin!
When the bride returns the initial call,
that scarf-pin adds conspicuously to her adornment.
The calm appropriation makes the
giver grind her teeth&mdash;- and the bride knows it.</p>

<p>In the man's presence, the keeper of his
heart and conscience will say, sweetly: "Oh,
my dear, such a dreadful thing has happened!
That exquisitely embroidered scarf you made
for Tom's chiffonier is utterly ruined! The
colours ran the first time it was washed.
You have no idea how I feel about it&mdash;it was
such a beautiful thing!"</p>

<p>The wretched donor of the scarf attempts
consolation by saying that it doesn't matter.
It never was intended for Tom, but as every
stitch in it was taken while he was with her,
he insisted that he must have it as a souvenir
of that happy summer. She adds that it was
carefully washed before it was given to him,
that she has never known that kind of silk to
fade, and that something must have been done
to it to make the colours run.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">A Pitched Battle</div>

<p>The short-sighted man at this juncture felicitates
himself because the two are getting on
so well together. He never realises that a
pitched battle has occurred under his very
nose, and that the honours are about even.</p>

<p>If Tom possesses a particularly unfortunate
flash-light photograph of the girl, the bride
joyfully frames it and puts it on the mantel
where all may see. If the original of the caricature
remonstrates, the happy wife sweetly
temporises and insists that it remain, because
"Tom is so fond of it," and says, "it looks
just like her."</p>

<p>Devious indeed are the paths of woman.
She far excels the "Heathen Chinee" in his
famous specialty of "ways that are dark and
tricks that are vain."</p>

<p>Courtship is a game that a girl has to play
without knowing the trump. The only way
she ever succeeds at it is by playing to an
imaginary trump of her own, which may be
either open, disarming friendliness, or simple
indifference.</p>

<p>When a man finds the way to a woman's
heart a boulevard, he has taken the wrong
road. When his path is easy and his burden<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
light, it is time for him to doubt. When his
progress seems like making a new way to
the Klondike, he needs only to keep his
courage and go on.</p>

<p>For, after all, it is woman who decides. A
clever girl may usually marry any man she
sees fit to honour with the responsibility of
her bills. The ardent lover counts for considerably
less than he is wont to suppose.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Only
One They
Know</div>

<p>There is a good old scheme which the
world of lovers has unanimously adopted,
in order to find out where they stand. It is
so simple as to make one weep, but it is the
only one they know. This consists of an intentional
absence, judiciously timed.</p>

<p>Suppose a man has been spending three or
four evenings a week with the same girl, for
a period of two or three months. Flowers,
books, and chocolates have occasionally appeared,
as well as invitations to the theatre.
The man has been fed out of the chafing-dish,
and also with accidental cake, for men are as
fond of sugar as women, though they are
ashamed to admit it.</p>

<p>Suddenly, without warning, the man misses
an evening, then another, then another. Two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
weeks go by, and still no man. The neighbours
and the family begin to ask questions
of a personal nature.</p>

<p>It is at this stage that the immature and
childish woman will write the man a note,
expressing regret for his long absence, and
trusting that nothing may interfere with their
"pleasant friendship." Sometimes the note
brings the man back immediately and sometimes
it doesn't. He very seldom condescends
to make an explanation. If he does, it is
merely a casual allusion to "business." This is
the only excuse even a bright man can think of.</p>

<div class="sidenote">"Climbing
a
Tree"</div>

<p>This act is technically known among girls
as "climbing a tree." When a man does it,
he wants a girl to bring a ladder and a lunch
and plead with him to come down and be
happy, but doing as he wishes is no way
to attract a man up a tree.</p>

<p>Men are as impervious to tears and pleadings
as a good mackintosh to mist, but at the
touch of indifference, they melt like wax. So
when her quondam lover attempts metaphorical
athletics, the wise girl smiles and withdraws
into her shell.</p>

<p>She takes care that he shall not see her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
unless he comes to her. She draws the
shades the moment the lamps are lighted. If
he happens to pass the house in the evening,
he may think she is out, or that she has company&mdash;it
is all the same to her. She arranges
various evenings with girl friends and gets
books from the library. This is known as
"provisioning the citadel for a siege."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pride and
Pride</div>

<p>It is a contest between pride and pride
which occurs in every courtship, and the girl
usually wins. True lovers are as certain to
return as Bo-Peep's flock or a systematically
deported cat. Shame-faced, but surely, the
man comes back.</p>

<p>Various laboratory note-books yield the
same result. A single entry indicates the
general trend of the affair.</p>

<p><i><span class="smcap">Man</span> calls on <span class="smcap">Girl</span> after five weeks of unexplained

days or two weeks, I guess."</p>

you remember?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Girl.</span> "I hadn't thought of it. It doesn't
seem that long. How time does fly, doesn't
it!" (<i>Long silence.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Man.</span> "I've been awfully busy. I wanted

<p><span class="smcap">Girl.</span> "I've been very busy, too." (<i>Voluminous

pleasant in character.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Man.</span> (<i>Tenderly.</i>) "Were you so busy you
didn't miss me?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Girl.</span> "Why, I can't say I missed you, exactly,
but I always thought of you pleasantly."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Man.</span> "Did you think of me often?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Girl.</span> (<i>Laughing.</i>) "I didn't keep any
record of it. Do you want me to cut a notch
in the handle of my parasol every time I think
of you? If all my friends were so exacting,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
I'd have time for nothing else. I'd need a
new one every week and the house would be
full of shavings. All my fingers would be
cut, too."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Man.</span> (<i>Unconsciously showing his hand.</i>)
"I thought you'd write me a note."</p>

<div class="sidenote">His Short
Suit</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Girl.</span> (<i>Leading his short suit.</i>) "You
could have waited on your front steps till the
garbage man took you away, and I wouldn't
have written you any note."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Man.</span> (<i>With evident sincerity.</i>) "That's
no dream! I could do just that!" (<i>Proposal
follows in due course, <span class="smcap">Man</span> making full and
complete confession.</i>)</p>

<p>If he is foolish enough to complicate his
game with another girl, he loses much more
than he gains, for he lowers the whole affair
to the level of a flirtation, and destroys any
belief the girl may have had in him. He also
forces her to do the same thing, in self-defence.
Flirtation is the only game in which it
is advisable and popular to trump one's partner's
ace.</p>

<p>He who would win a woman must challenge
her admiration, prove himself worthy
of her regard, appeal to her sympathy&mdash;and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
then wound her. She is never wholly his
until she realises that he has the power to
make her miserable as well as to make her
happy, and that love is an infinite capacity for
suffering.</p>

<p>A man who does it consciously is apt to
overdo it, out of sheer enthusiasm, and if a
girl suspects that it is done intentionally, the
hurt loses its sting and changes her love to
bitterness. A succession of attempts is also
useless, for a man never hurts a woman twice
in exactly the same way. When he has run
the range of possible stabs, she is out of his
reach&mdash;unless she is his wife.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A State
Secret</div>

<p>The intentional absence scheme is too transparent
to succeed, and temporary devotion to
another girl is definite damage to his cause,
for it indicates fickleness and instability.
There is only one way by which a man may
discover his true position without asking any
questions, and that is&mdash;a state secret. Now
and then a man strikes it by accident, but nobody
ever tells&mdash;even brothers or platonic
friends.</p>

<p>Some men select a wife as they would a
horse, paying due attention to appearance, gait,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
disposition, age, teeth, and grooming. High
spirits and a little wildness are rather desirable
than otherwise, if both are young. Men who
have had many horses or many wives and have
grown old with both, have a slight inclination
toward sedate ways and domestic traits.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The "Woman's
Column"</div>

<p>Modern society makes it fully as easy to
choose the one as the other. In communities
where the chaperone idea is at its prosperous
zenith, a man may see a girl under nearly all
circumstances. The men who conduct the
"Woman's Column" in many pleasing
journals are still writing of the effect it has
on a man to catch a girl in curl papers of a
morning, though curl papers have been obsolete
for many and many a moon.</p>

<p>Cycling, golf, and kindred out-door amusements
have been the death of careless morning
attire. Uncorseted woman is unhappy
woman, and the girl of whom the versatile
journalist writes died long ago. Perhaps it is
because a newspaper man can write anything
at four minutes' notice and do it well, that the
press fairly reeks with "advice to women."</p>

<p>The question, propounded in a newspaper
column, "What Kind of a Girl Does a Man<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
Like Best," will bring out a voluminous symposium
which adds materially to the gaiety
of the nation. It would be only fair to have
this sort of thing temporarily reversed&mdash;to tell
men how to make home happy for their
wives and how to keep a woman's love, after
it has once been given.</p>

<p>Some clever newspaper woman might win
everlasting laurels for herself if she would
contribute to this much neglected branch of
human knowledge. How is a man to know
that a shirt-front which looks like a railroad
map diverts one's mind from his instructive
remarks? How is he to know that a cane is
a nuisance when he fares forth with a girl?
It is true that sisters might possibly attempt
this, but the modern sister is heavily overworked
at present and it is not kind to
suggest an addition to her cares.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Neglected
By His
Kind</div>

<p>There is no advice of any sort given to men
except on the single subject of choosing a
wife. This is to be found only in the books
in the Sabbath-School library, or in occasional
columns of the limited number of saffron
dailies which illuminate the age. Surely, man
has been neglected by his kind!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Indecision</div>

<p>The general masculine attitude indicates
widespread belief in the promise, "Ask, and
ye shall receive." A man will tell his best
friend that he doesn't know whether to marry
a certain girl. If she hears of his indecision
there is trouble ahead, if he finally decides in
the affirmative, and it is quite possible that he
may not marry her.</p>

<p>After the door of a woman's heart has once
swung on its silent hinges, a man thinks he
can prop it open with a brick and go away
and leave it. A storm is apt to displace the
brick, however&mdash;and there is a heavy spring
on the door. Woe to the masculine finger
that is in the way!</p>

<p>A man often hesitates between two young
women and asks his friends which he shall
marry. Custom has permitted the courtship
of both and neither has the right to feel aggrieved,
because it is exceedingly bad form
for a girl to love a man before he has asked
her to.</p>

<p>Now and then a third girl is a man's confidante
at this trying period. Nothing so
bores a person as to be a man's "guide, philosopher
and friend" in his perplexities with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
other girls. To one distinct class of women
men tell their troubles and the other class
sees that they have plenty to tell. It is better
to be in the second category than in the first.</p>

<p>Sooner or later, the confidante explains the
whole affair to the subjects of the confidence
and strange, new kinds of trouble immediately
come to the rash man. It is a common
failing to expect another person to keep a
secret which we have just proved is beyond
our own capability.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Adamantine
Fortress</div>

<p>When a man has once deeply wounded a
woman's pride, he may just as well give up
his hope of winning her. At that barrier, the
little blind god may plead in vain. Love's
face may be sad, his big, sightless eyes soft
with tears, and his helpless hands outstretched
in pleading and prayer, but that
stern sentinel will never yield. Wounded
love is easily forgiven, wounded belief sometimes
forgotten, but wounded pride&mdash;never.
It is the adamantine fortress. There is only
one path which leads to the house of forgiveness&mdash;that
of understanding, and it is impassable
if woman's pride has come between.</p>

<p>A girl never knows whether a courtship<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
is in progress or not, unless a man tells her.
He may be interested and amused, but not
in love. It is only in the comic papers that
a stern parent waits upon the continuous
caller and demands to know his "intentions,"
so a girl must, perforce, be her own guide.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Continuous
Caller</div>

<p>A man may call upon a girl so constantly
and so regularly that the neighbours daily
expect wedding invitations, and the family
inquire why he does not have his trunk sent
to the house. Later, quite casually, he will
announce his engagement to a girl who is
somewhere else. This fianc&eacute;e is always a
peculiarly broad-minded girl who knows all
about her lover's attentions to the other and
does not in the least object. She wants him
to "have a good time" when he is away
from her, and he is naturally anxious to please
her. He wants the other girl to know his
wife&mdash;he is sure they will be good friends.</p>

<p>Lasting feminine friendships are not built
upon foundations of that kind. It is very
unfortunate, for the world would be gladdened
by many more than now exist.</p>

<p>According to geometry, "things which are
equal to the same thing are equal to each<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
other," and it would seem, from the standpoint
of pure reason, that people who are
fond of the same people would naturally be
congenial and take pleasure in being together.</p>

<p>But a sensitive spinster is often grieved
when she discovers that her men friends do
not readily assimilate. If she leaves two of
them to entertain each other, the conversation
does not flow with desirable spontaneity.
There is no lack of courtesy between them,
however, even of that finer sort which keeps
them both there, lest one, by leaving, should
seem to remind his companion that it was
late.</p>

<p>On the contrary, if a man is fond of two
different girls, they are seldom to be seen
apart. They exchange long visits regularly
and this thoughtfulness often saves him from
making an extra call.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Happy
Triumvirate</div>

<p>A happy triumvirate is thus formed and
the claws of it do not show. Sometimes
it is hard to decide between them, and he
cuts the Gordian knot by marrying someone
else, but the friendship is never the same
afterward. The girls are no longer boon
companions and when the man crosses their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
paths, they manage to convey the impression
of great distance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Narrowed
Down to
Two</div>

<p>In the beginning, almost any number may
join in the game, but the inevitable process
of selection eventually narrows it down to
two. Society has given men a little the best
of it, but perhaps woman's finer sight compensates
her for the apparent disadvantages&mdash;and
even Love, who deals the cards, is
too blind to see the fatal consequences of his
mistakes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<h2 style="color: red;">The Natural History of Proposals</h2>


<div class="sidenote">The Inquiring
Spinster</div>

<p>There is no subject which presents more
difficulties to the inquiring spinster.
Contemporary spinsters, when approached
upon the topic, are anything but encouraging;
apparently lacking the ability to distinguish
between impertinent intrusion into their personal
affairs and the scientific spirit which
prompts the collection of statistics.</p>

<p>Married women, when asked to repeat the
exact language of the lover at the happy moment,
are wont to transfix the sensitive aspirant
for knowledge with lofty scorn. Mothers
are accustomed to dissemble and say they
"have forgotten." Men in general are uncommunicative,
though occasionally some
rare soul will expand under the influence of
food and freely give more valuable information
than can be extracted from an indefinite
number of women.</p>

<p>One's own experience is naturally limited,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
even though proposals constitute the main joy
and excitement of the spinster's monotonous
life. Emerson says: "All is sour if seen as
experience," though the gentle sage was not
referring especially to offers of marriage.
Nevertheless, there is a charm about other
people's affairs which would render life beautiful
indeed if it could be added to one's own.</p>

<p>Nothing strengthens a woman's self-confidence
like a proposal. One is a wonder, two
a superfluity, and three an epidemic. Four
are proof of unusual charm, five go to the
head, and it is a rare girl whom six or seven
will not permanently spoil.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Disillusion</div>

<p>To the girl fed upon fiction, the first proposal
comes in the nature of a shock. Disillusion
follows as a matter of course. Men,
evidently, do not read fiction, or at least do
not profit by the valuable hints to be found in
any novel.</p>

<p>A small book entitled: <i>How Men Propose</i>,
was eagerly sought by young women who
were awaiting definite experience. This was
discovered to be a collection of proposals carefully
selected from fiction. It was done with
care and discernment, but was not satisfying.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
The natural inference was that the actual
affairs were just like those in the book.</p>

<div class="sidenote">"In
Books?"</div>

<p>Nothing can exceed the grace and tenderness
with which men propose&mdash;in books.
Such chivalrous worship, such pleasing deference
is accorded&mdash;in books! Such pretty
pleading, such knightly vows of eternal allegiance,
as are always found&mdash;in books!</p>

<p>The hero of a few years back was wont to
make his offer on his knees. He also haunted
the home of the beloved maiden, deeming
himself well repaid for five hours wait if he
had a fleeting glimpse of her at the window.
Torn hair was frequent, and refusal drove
men to suicide and madness.</p>

<p>The young women who were the cause of
all this trouble were never more than eighteen
or twenty years of age. Mature spinsters of
twenty-five figured as envious deterrents in
the happy affair. Many a story-book marriage
has been spoiled by the jealousy of the
wrinkled rival of twenty-five.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The First
Proposal</div>

<p>The violent protestations of the lover in the
novel were indeed something to be awaited
with fear and trembling. With her anticipations
aroused by this kind of reading and her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
eagerness whetted by interminable years of
waiting, Mademoiselle receives her first offer
of marriage.</p>

<p>She is in doubt, at first, as to whether it is a
proposal. It seems like some dreadful mistake.
Where is the courtly manner of the
lover in the book? What is the matter with this
red-faced boy? Where is the pretty pleading,
the gracious speech? Why should a
lover stammer and confuse his verbs?</p>

<p>Mademoiselle recoils in disgust. This, then,
is what she has been waiting for. It is not at
all like the book. Her lover is entirely different
from other girls' lovers&mdash;so different that
he is pathetic.</p>

<p>Her faith in the gospel of romance is sadly
shaken, when the next experience is a great
deal like the first. No one, in the book, could
doubt the lover's meaning. Yet in the halting
sentences and confused metaphors of actual
experience, there is sometimes much question
as to what he really means. A girl often has
to ask a man if he has just proposed to her,
that she may accept or refuse, in a gracious
and proper way.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Ordeal</div>

<p>In a girl's early ideas on the subject, she has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
much sympathy for the man who has to
undergo the ordeal of asking a woman to be
his wife. She thinks he must contemplate
the momentous step for weeks, await the opportunity
with expectant terror, and when
his lady is in a happy mood, recite with fear
and trembling, the proposal which he has
written out and learned, appropriately enough,
by heart.</p>

<p>Later, she comes to know that after the first
few times, men propose as thoughtlessly and
easily as they dress for dinner, that they devote
no particular study to the art, that constant
practice makes them proficient, and that
almost any girl will do when the proposal
mood is on.</p>

<p>She discovers that they often do it simply
to make a pleasing impression upon a girl,
with no thought of acceptance. Many an
engagement is more of a surprise to the man
than to anybody else.</p>

<p>Because fiction comes very near to the
heart of woman, she invariably follows its dictates
and shows great astonishment at every
proposal. The women who have been thus
surprised are even more rare than days in June.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The False
and
the True</div>

<p>When a man begins to compare a girl to a
flower, a baby, or a kitten, she knows what
is coming next. She spends her mental energy
in distinguishing the false from the true&mdash;which
is sufficient employment for anyone.
There is not enough cerebral tissue to waste
much of it upon unnecessary processes.</p>

<p>It is very hard to tell whether a man really
means a proposal. It may have been made
under romantic circumstances, or because he
was lonesome for the other girl, or, in the
case of an heiress, because he was tired of
work. Longing for the absent sweetheart
will frequently cause a man to become engaged
to someone near by, because, though
absence may make a woman's heart grow
fonder, it is presence that plays the mischief
with a man. No wise girl would accept a
man who proposed by moonlight or just after
a meal. The dear things aren't themselves
then.</p>

<p>Food, properly served, will attract a proposal
at almost any time, especially if it is
known that the pleasing viands were of the
girl's own making. Cooking and love may
seem at first glance to be widely separated,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
but no woman can have one without the
other. The brotherly love for all creation,
which emanates from the well-fed man, overflows,
concentrates, and naturally becomes a
proposal.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Written
Proposals</div>

<p>Other things being equal, a written proposal
is apt to be genuine, especially if it is
signed with the full name and address of the
writer, and the date is not omitted. Long
and painful experience in the courts of his
country has made man wary of direct evidence.</p>

<p>But a written proposal is extremely bad
form. A girl never can be sure that her lover
did not attempt to fish it out of the letter-box
after it had slipped from his fingers. The
author of <i>How to Be Happy, Though Married</i>,
once saw a miserable young man attempting
to get his convicting letter back by
means of a forked stick. The sight must be
quite common everywhere. Proposing in
haste and repenting at leisure is not by any
means unusual.</p>

<p>Then, too, a girl misses a possible opportunity
of seeing a man blush and stammer.
One does not often get a chance to see a man<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
willingly making himself ridiculous, and the
spectacle is worth waiting for.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Confusion
and Awkwardness</div>

<p>Confusion and awkwardness are high trumps
with a woman, for they indicate inexperience
and uncertainty. The man who proposes in
a finished and nonchalant manner, as if he
had done it frequently and were sure of the
result, is now and then astonished at a refusal.
It is also a risk to offer a ring immediately
after acceptance. The suspicion is that the
ring has been worn before, or else the man
was sure enough of the girl to invest heavily
in his future.</p>

<p>Sometimes a man will disclose to a platonic
friend the form he habitually employs in proposals.
The hero of battle engagements has
proverbial charm for woman, and the hero of
matrimonial engagements is meat and drink
to the spinster athirst for knowledge.</p>

<p>Feed the man, and when the brotherly love
for the entire universe begins to radiate, approach
him gently upon the subject.</p>

<p>"Why, bless your little heart," the man
will say, "of course I'll tell you about it.
Yes, you're right in supposing that I know
more about it than anyone else you know.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
I've never been refused in my life and I know
I've asked a hundred. I've had medals for that.</p>

<p>"I always try to make each one different,"
he will continue. "Girls sometimes compare
notes and it makes it awkward. The girl I'm
engaged to now doesn't know any of my
other girls, though, so I'm safe enough.</p>

<div class="sidenote">"One of
the Best
Proposals"</div>

<p>"I'll never forget the way I did that. I
think it was one of the best proposals I ever
made. She's a mighty pretty little thing,&mdash;blue
eyes and black hair,&mdash;a regular Irish type.
I must tell you first, though, how I came to
know her.</p>

<p>"The one I was engaged to just before I
asked her, had just broken it off on account
of property which her children would lose if
she married again. She was a widow, you
know. I've told you about her&mdash;the one
with red hair. Between you and me, that's
the only woman in God's world my heart
ever went out to. That is the love of my
life. Her little girl, eleven years old, was in
love with me, too. She used to tremble when
I kissed her, and was jealous of her mother.
But this little girl I'm engaged to now, why
I just love the ground she walks on.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">"A Very
Peculiar
Affair"</div>

<p>"Well," after a pause, "this was a very
peculiar affair. Of course I was all broken up
over losing her&mdash;couldn't eat nor sleep&mdash;I
was a perfect wreck. This old friend of
mine happened along, and he says, 'You'll
have to brace up, old man. Come on out to
my house in the country and rest up a bit.'
So I went, and met his daughter.</p>

<p>"Five days after I met her, I asked him for
her hand. I explained it to him just as I
would to my own father, and he understood
all right. He's a fine fellow. He said I
could have her. Of course I'd asked her
first.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I'm getting to that. I took her out
for a walk one afternoon, and when we came
to the river, we sat down to talk. It was a
perfect day. I began by saying how sad it
was to see a beautiful flower and to know
that it was out of one's reach, or to see anything
beautiful and know that one never could
possess it. I led up to the subject by gentle
degrees, and then I said: 'You must have
seen that I love you, and you know without
my telling you, that I want you to be my
wife. I don't say I want you to marry me,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
because I want you to do more than that&mdash;I
want you to be my wife.' (Fine distinction
that!)</p>

<p>"Well, she was very much surprised, of
course, but she accepted me all right. Yes,
I told her about the other woman, but in such
a way that she understood it perfectly. Lots
of other fellows wanted her and I snatched
the prize from right under their very noses.
I don't suppose I'll ever propose any more
now. I'd never propose to you, even if I
were free to do so, because I know you'd
refuse me. You'd refuse me, wouldn't you?
Somebody else might just as well have me,
if you don't want me."</p>

<div class="sidenote">In Spite
of Varied
Resources</div>

<p>Yet in spite of the varied resources at
woman's command, we sometimes hear of
one who yearns for the privilege of seeking
man in marriage. The woman who longs
for the right to propose is evidently not
bright enough to bring a man to the point.</p>

<p>Still worse than this, there are cases on
record where women, not reigning queens,
have actually proposed to men. The men
who are thus sought in the bonds of matrimony
are not slow to tell of it, confining<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
themselves usually to their own particular
circle of men friends. But the news sometimes
filters through man's capacity to keep a
secret, and the knowledge is diffused among
interested spinsters.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hints</div>

<p>What men term "hints" are not out of
place, for the proposal market would be less
active, were it not for "hints." But these
are seldom given in words&mdash;unless a man
happens to be particularly stupid.</p>

<p>When the proposal habit is not firmly
fastened upon a man, and he begins to have
serious designs upon some one girl, she knows
it long before he does. Incidentally, the family
and the neighbours have their suspicions.</p>

<p>Woman, with her strong dramatic instinct,
wishes the proposal to occur according to
accepted rules. Hence, if a man shows symptoms
of whispering the momentous question
in a crowd, he is apt to be delicately discouraged,
and if the girl is not satisfied with her
own appearance, there will also be postponement.
No girl wants to be proposed to
when her hair is dishevelled, her collar
wilted, and her soul distraught by pestiferous
mosquitoes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<p>But an ambitious and painstaking girl will
arrange the stage for a proposal, with untiring
patience, months before it actually happens.
When she practices assiduously all the morning,
that she may execute difficult passages
with apparent ease in the evening, and
willingly turns the freezer that there may be
cooling ice opportunely left after dinner, to
"melt if somebody doesn't eat it," she expects
something to happen.</p>

<p>When the man finally appears, and the
little brother marches off like a well-trained
soldier, with two nickels jingling in his
pocket, even the victim might be on his
guard. When the family are unceremoniously
put out of the house, and father, mother, and
sisters are seen in the summer twilight, wandering
in disconsolate pairs, let the neighbours
keep away from the house under penalty of
the girl's lasting hate.</p>

<p>Sometimes, when the family have been put
out, and the common human interest leads
intimate spinster friends to pass the house,
there is nothing to be seen but the girl playing
accompaniments for the man while he
sings.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<p>Yet the initiated know, for if a girl only
praises a man's singing enough, he will most
surely propose to her before many moons
have passed. The scheme has a two-fold
purpose, because all may see that he finds the
house attractive, and if no engagement is announced,
the entire affair may easily be explained
upon musical and platonic grounds.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Formal
Proposal</div>

<p>Owing to the distorted methods of courtship
which prevail at the present day, a girl
may never be sure that a man really cares for
her until he makes a formal proposal. If a
man were accepted the minute he proposed,
he would think the girl had been his for some
time, and would unconsciously class her as
among those easily won.</p>

<p>The insinuation that she has been easily
won is the thing which is not to be borne.
It may have been simple enough, in fact, but
let a man beware how he trifles with this
delicate subject, even after fifty years of marriage.</p>

<div class="sidenote">On
Probation</div>

<p>Consequently, it is the proper thing to take
the matter under advisement and never to accept
definitely without a period of probation.
This is the happiest time of a girl's life. She is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
absolutely sure of her lover and may administer
hope, fear, doubt, and discouragement to her
heart's content.</p>

<p>The delicate attentions which are showered
upon her are the envy of every spinster on the
street who does not know the true state of the
affair. Sometimes, with indifferent generosity,
she divides her roses and invites the less
fortunate to share her chocolates. This always
pleases the man, if he knows about
it.</p>

<p>Also, because she is not in the least bound,
she makes the best of this last freedom and
accepts the same courtesies from other men.
Nothing is so well calculated to sound the
depths of original sin in man's nature, as to
find his rival's roses side by side with his,
when a girl has him on probation. And he
never feels so entirely similar to an utter idiot,
as when he sees a girl to whom he has definitely
committed himself, flirting cheerfully
with two or three other men.</p>

<p>Woe be to him if he remonstrates! For
Mademoiselle is testing him with this end
in view. If he complains bitterly of her outrageous
behaviour, she dismisses him with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
sorrowful dignity, jealousy being the one
thing she cannot tolerate in men.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Opportunity
for
Fine
Work</div>

<p>There is opportunity for fine work in the
situation which the young woman immediately
develops. A man may take his choice
of the evils which lie before him, for almost
anything may happen.</p>

<p>He may complain, and if he shows anger,
there is war. If he betrays jealousy, there is
trouble which marriage will accentuate, rather
than lessen. If he shows concern because his
beloved is so fickle, and insinuates that so unstable
a person will not make a good wife, he
touches pride in a vital spot and his cause is
no more. Let him be manfully unconcerned;
as far above jealousy and angry reproach as a
St. Bernard is above a kitten&mdash;and Mademoiselle
is his.</p>

<p>Philosophers laugh at woman's fickleness,
but her constancy, when once awakened,
endures beyond life and death, and sometimes
beyond betrayal. But this is not to be won
by a jealous man, for jealousy is the mother-in-law
of selfishness, and a woman never
permits a man to rival her in her own particular
field.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Another
Danger</div>

<p>If a man safely passes the test of probation,
there is yet another danger which lies between
him and the realisation of his ambition. This
is the tendency of women to conduct excavations
into a man's previous affairs.</p>

<p>He needs the wisdom of the serpent at this
juncture, for under the smiling sweetness a
dagger is often concealed. If the point is allowed
to show during an engagement, the
whole blade will frequently flash during marriage.</p>

<p>"Yes, dearest," a man will say, tenderly,
"I have loved before, but that was long ago&mdash;long
before I met you. She was beautiful,
tall, dark, majestic, with a regal nature like
herself&mdash;Good Heavens, how I loved her!"</p>

<p>This is apt to continue for some little time,
if a man gets thoroughly interested in his subject
and thinks he is talking rather well, before
he discovers that his petite blonde divinity
is either a frozen statue, or a veritable Niobe
as to tears. And not one man in three hundred
and nineteen ever suspects what he has
done!</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Thought
of
Defection</div>

<p>A woman is more jealous of the girls a man
has loved, whom she has never seen, than of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
any number of attractive rivals. In the blind
adoration which he yields her, she takes no
thought of immediate defection, for her smile
always makes him happy&mdash;her voice never
loses its mystic power over his senses.</p>

<p>On the contrary, a man never stoops to be
jealous of the men who have pleaded in vain
for what he has won, nor even of possible
fianc&eacute;s whom later discretion has discarded.
He is sure of her at the present moment and
his doubt centres itself comfortably upon the
future, which is always shadowy and unreal
to a man, because he is less imaginative than
woman.</p>

<p>And yet&mdash;there is no more dangerous companion
for a woman than the man who has
loved her. It is easier to waken a woman's
old love than to teach her a new affection.
Strangely enough, the woman a man has once
loved and then forgotten is powerless in the
after years. A man's dead friendship may
dream of resurrection, but never his dead
love.</p>

<p>Jealousy and distrust have never yet won a
doubting heart. Bitterness never accomplishes
miracles which sweetness fails to do.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
Too often men and women spend their time
in wondering why they are not loved, trying
various schemes and pitiful experiments, and
passing by the simple method of trying to be
lovable and unconscious of self.</p>

<div class="sidenote">"The
Milk of
Human
Kindness"</div>

<p>"The milk of human kindness" seldom
produces cream, but there is only one way by
which love may be won or kept. Perfection
means a continual shifting of standards and
must ever be unattainable, but the man or
woman who is simply lovable will be wholly
taken into other hearts&mdash;faults and all.</p>

<p>Now and then a man's love is hopeless,
from causes which are innate and beyond
control. Sometimes regret strikes deep and
lasts for more than a day, as in the pages of
the story books which women love to read.
Sometimes, too, a tender-hearted woman,
seeing far into the future, will do her best to
spare a fellow-creature pain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Wine
of Conquest</div>

<p>But this is the exception, rather than the
rule. The average woman regards a certain
number of proposals as but a just tribute to
her own charm. Sometimes she sees what
she has unconsciously done when it is too
late to retreat, but even then, though pity,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
regret, and honest pain may result from it,
there is one effect more certain still&mdash;the intoxication
of the wine of conquest, against
which no woman is proof.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<h2 style="color: red;">Love Letters: Old and New</h2>


<div class="sidenote">The Average
Love
Letter</div>

<p>The average love letter is sufficient to make
a sensitive spinster weep, unless she
herself is in love and the letter be addressed to
her. The first stage of the tender passion
renders a man careless as to his punctuation,
the second seriously affects his spelling, and
in the last period of the malady, his grammar
develops locomotor ataxia. The single blessedness
of school-teachers is largely to be
attributed to this cause.</p>

<p>A real love letter is absolutely ridiculous to
everyone except the writer and the recipient.
A composition, which repeats the same term
of endearment thirteen times on a page, has
certainly no particular claim to literary art.</p>

<p>When a man writes a love letter, dated, and
fully identified by name and address, there is
no question but that he is in earnest. A large
number of people consider nothing so innocently
entertaining as love letters, read in a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
court-room, with due attention to effect, by
the counsel for the other side.</p>

<p>Affairs of that kind are given scarlet headlines
in the saffron journals, and if the letters
are really well done, it means the sale of an
"extra." No man can hope to write anything
which will possess such general interest
as his love letters. If Shakespeare had written
voluminously to his sweetheart&mdash;to any of his
sweethearts&mdash;and the letters should be found
by this generation, what a hue and cry would
be raised over his peaceful ashes!</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sins of
Commission</div>

<p>Doing the things which ought not to be
done never loses fascination and charm. The
rare pleasure thus obtained far exceeds the
enjoyment of leaving undone things which
ought to be done. Sins of commission are
far more productive of happiness than the sins
of omission.</p>

<div class="sidenote">For Posterity</div>

<p>Thus people whose sense of honour would
not permit them to read an open letter which
belonged to someone else will go by thousands
to purchase the published letters of some
famous man. Dr. Arbuthnot, in speaking of
the publication of letters, said that it added a
new terror to death, so true it is that while a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
man may think for the present, he unavoidably
writes for posterity.</p>

<p>No passion is too sacred to be hidden from
the eagle eye of the public. The death of anyone
of more than passing fame is followed by
a volume of "letters." It is pathetic to read
these posthumous pages, which should have
been buried with the hands that wrote them,
or consigned to the never-failing mercy of the
flames.</p>

<p>Burial has not always sufficed. The manuscript
of one well-known book of poems was
buried with the lady to whom they were
written, but in later years her resting-place
was disturbed, with the consent of her lover,
for this very manuscript.</p>

<p>Her golden hair had grown after her death,
and was found closely entwined with the
written pages&mdash;so closely that it had to be cut.
The loving embrace which Death would not
break was rudely forced to yield. Even in her
"narrow house" she might not keep her love
letters in peace, since the public wanted to
read what had been written for her alone and
the publisher was waiting for "copy."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letters in
a Grave</div>

<p>In a paper of the <i>Tatler</i>, written by Addison<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
or Steele, or possibly by both, is described a
party in a country village which is suddenly
broken into confusion by the entrance of the
sexton of their parish church, fresh from
the digging of a grave. The sexton tells the
merrymakers how a chance blow of his pickaxe
has opened a decayed coffin, in which are
discovered several papers.</p>

<p>These are found to be the love letters received
by the wife of Sir Thomas Chichley,
one of the admirals of King William. Most
of the letters were ruined by damp and
mould, but "here and there," says the <i>Tatler</i>,
"a few words such as 'my soul,' 'dearest,'
'roses,' and 'my angel,' still remained legible,
resisting the corrupting influence of Time."</p>

<p>One of these letters in a grave, which Lady
Chichley had requested might be buried with
her in her coffin, was found entire, though
discoloured by the lapse of twenty years.
Its words were these:</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Madam</span>:</p>

<p>"If you would know the greatness of my
love, consider that of your own beauty.
That blooming countenance, that snowy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
bosom, that graceful person, return every
moment to my imagination; the brightness
of your eyes hindered me from closing mine
since I last saw you. You may still add to
your beauties by a smile. A frown will
make me the most wretched of men, as I am
the most passionate of lovers."</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Advertisement</div>

<p>Death is the advertisement, at the end of
an autobiography, wherein people discover
its virtues. The public which refused a bare
subsistence to the living genius will make
his children comfortable by generously purchasing
his letters, which were never meant
for them.</p>

<p>The pathetic story of the inner struggle,
which would have crucified the sensitive soul
were it known to any save his dearest friends,
is proudly blazoned forth&mdash;in print! Hopes
and fears and trials are no longer concealed.
Illness, poverty, and despair are given rubricated
pages. The sorrowful letter to a friend,
asking for five or ten dollars, is reproduced in
facsimile.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Soldier of
the World</div>

<p>That it shows the human side of the genius
is no excuse for the desecration. What of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
the sunny soul who always sang courage,
while he himself was suffering from hope deferred!
What of him who wrote in an attic,
often hungry for his daily bread, and took
care to give the impression of warmth and
comfort! Why should his stern necessity be
disclosed to the public that would not give
him bread in return for his songs? It is
enough to make the gallant soldier of the
world turn uneasily in his grave.</p>

<p>In this way a bit of the greatness so bravely
won is often lost, and sometimes illusions are
dispelled which all must regret. For years,
we have read with delight Mrs. Browning's
exquisite poem beginning:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I have a name, a little name<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Uncadenced for the ear."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Throughout the poem there is no disclosure,
but, so sure is her art, that there is no sense
of loss or wonder. But the pitiless searchlight
of the century is turned upon the
Browning love letters, and thus we learn that
Mrs. Browning's pet name was <i>Ba</i>!</p>

<p>Pretty enough, perhaps, when spoken by a
lover and a poet, or in shaded nooks, to the
music of Italian streams, but quite unsuited to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
the present, even though it were to be read
only by lovers equally fond.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Though I write books, it will be read<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Upon the page of none&mdash;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Poor Mrs. Browning! Little did she
know!</p>

<div class="sidenote">With the
Future in
View</div>

<p>There have been some, no doubt, who have
written with the future in view, though
Abelard, who broke a woman's heart, could
not have foreseen that his only claims to distinction
would rest upon his letters to loving,
faithful H&eacute;loise. The life which was to be
too great for her to share is remembered now
only because of her. Mocking Fate has
brought the wronged woman an exquisite
revenge.</p>

<p>That delightful spendthrift and scapegrace,
Richard Steele, has left a large number of
whimsical letters, addressed to the lady he
married. She might possibly object to their
publication, but not Steele! Indeed, she was
a foolish woman to keep this letter:</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Prue:</span></p>

<p>"The afternoon coach will bring you ten
pounds. Your letter shows that you are pas<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>sionately
in love with me. But we must take
our portion of life without repining and I consider
that good nature, added to the beautiful
form God has given you, would make our
happiness too great for human life. Your
most obliged husband and most humble
servant,</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap" style="margin-left: 10em;">Rich. Steele.</span>"<br />
</p>

<p>Alexander Pope was another who wrote for
posterity. In spite of his deformity, he appears
to have been touched to the heart by
women, but vanity and selfishness tinged all
of his letters.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Systematic
Lovers</div>

<p>Robert Burns was a systematic lover of anything
in petticoats, and has left such a mass
of amatory correspondence that his biographer
was sorely perplexed. There could not have
been a pretty maid in the British Isles, to
whom chance had been kind, who had not
somewhere the usual packet of love letters
from "Bobby" Burns.</p>

<p>Laurence Sterne was no less generous with
his affection, if the stories are true. At
twenty, he fell in love with Elizabeth Lumley,
and from his letters to her, one might easily
fancy that love was a devastating and hopeless<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
disease. There was a pretty little "Kitty"
who claimed his devotion, and countless other
affairs, before "Eliza" appeared. "Eliza"
was a married woman and apparently the
last love of the heart-scarred Sterne.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Left by
the Dead</div>

<p>No earthly thing is so nearly immortal as a
love letter, and nothing is so sorrowful as
those left by the dead. The beautiful body
may be dust and all but forgotten, while the
work of the loving hands lives on. Even
those written by the ancient Egyptians are
seemingly imperishable. The clay tablet on
which one of the Pharaohs wrote a love letter,
asking the hand of a foreign princess, is to-day
in the British Museum.</p>

<p>The first time a woman cries after she is
married, she reads over all the love letters the
other men have written her, for a love letter is
something a tender-hearted woman cannot
bring herself to destroy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The New
Child</div>

<p>The love letters of the man she did not
marry still possess lingering interest. The
letters of many a successful man of affairs
are still hidden in the treasure-box of the
woman he loved, but did not marry. Both
have formed other ties and children have risen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
up to call them blessed, or whatever the
children may please, for even more dreadful
than the new woman is the new child. Between
them, they are likely to produce a new
man.</p>

<p>The new child is apt to find the letters and
read them aloud to the wrong people, being
most successfully unexpected and inopportune.
A box of old letters, distributed sparingly
at the doors of mutual friends, is the
distinguishing feature of a lovely game called
"playing postman." Social upheavals have
occurred from so small a cause as this.</p>

<p>It sometimes happens, too, that when a girl
has promised to marry a man and the wedding
day is set, she receives from a mutual friend a
package of faded letters and a note which runs
something like this:</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My Dear:</span></p>

<p>"Now that my old friend's wedding day is
approaching, I feel that I have no longer the
right to keep his letters. They are too beautiful
and tender to be burned and I have not
the heart to make that disposition of them.
Were I to return them to him, he would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
doubtless toss them into the fire, and I cannot
bear to have them lost.</p>

<p>"So, after thinking about it for some time,
I have concluded to send them to you, who
are the rightful keeper of his happiness, as
well as of his letters. I trust that you may
find a place for these among those which he
has addressed to you. Wishing you all happiness
in the future, believe me to be</p>

<p>"Very sincerely and affectionately yours."</p>

<div class="sidenote">On the
Firing
Line</div>

<p>The dainty and appropriate wedding gift is
not often shown to the happy man, but every
page and every line is carefully read. Now
and then the bride-elect advances boldly to the
firing line and writes a letter of thanks after
this fashion:</p>

<p>"It is very sweet and thoughtful of you,
my dear friend, to send me the letters. Of
course I shall keep them in with mine, though
I have but few, for the dear boy has never
been able to leave me for more than a day,
since first we met.</p>

<p>"Long before we became engaged, he
made me a present of your letters to him,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
which he said were well worth the reading,
and indeed, I have found them so. I shall
arrange them according to date and sequence,
though I observe that you have written much
more often than he&mdash;I suppose because we
foolish women can never say all we want to
in one letter and are compelled to add postscripts,
sometimes days apart.</p>

<p>"Believe me, I fully appreciate your wishes
for our happiness. I trust you may come to
us often and see how your hopes are fulfilled.
With many thanks for your loving thought of
me, as ever,</p>

<p>Affectionately yours."</p>

<div class="sidenote">If a Girl is
in Love</div>

<p>If a girl is in love, she carries the last letter
inside her shirt-waist in the day time, and puts
it under her pillow at night, thereby expecting
dreams of the beloved.</p>

<p>But the dispenser of nocturnal visions delights
in joking, and though impalpable arms
may seem to surround the sleeping spinster
and a tender kiss may be imprinted upon her
lips, it is not once in seventeen days that the
caresses are bestowed by the writer of the letter.
It is a politician whose distorted picture<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
has appeared in the evening paper, some man
the girl despises, the postman, or worse
yet, the tramp who has begged bread at the
door.</p>

<div class="sidenote">When a
Man is in
Love</div>

<p>When a man is in love, he carries the girl's
last letter in his pocket until he has answered
it and has another to take its place. He
stoops to no such superstition as placing it
under his pillow. Neither is it read as often
as his letters to her.</p>

<p>A woman never really writes to the man
she loves. She simply records her fleeting
moods&mdash;her caprice, her tenderness, and her
dreams. Because of this, she is often misunderstood.
If the letter of to-day is different
from that of yesterday, her lover, in his heart
at least, accuses her of fickleness.</p>

<p>A man's letters to a girl are very frequently
shown to her most intimate friend, if they
are sufficiently ardent, but a man never shows
the letters of a woman he truly cares for,
unless he feels the need of some other masculine
intellect to assist him in comprehending
the lady of his heart.</p>

<p>"Nothing feeds the flame like a letter. It
has intent, personality, secrecy." But that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
is love indeed which stands the test of long
separation&mdash;and letters.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Single
Drop of
Ink</div>

<p>With a single drop of ink for a mirror, the
old Egyptian sorcerer promised to reveal the
past and foretell the future. The single drop
of ink with which a lover writes may sadly
change the blissful future of which he dreams.</p>

<p>The written word is so sadly different from
that which is spoken! The malicious demon
concealed in the ink bottle delights in wrecking
love. Misunderstandings and long silences
follow in rapid succession, tenderness
changes to coldness, and love to bitter regret.</p>

<p>Someone has said that the true test of
congeniality is not a matter of tastes, but of
humour. If two people find the same things
amusing, their comradeship is a foregone
conclusion, but even so, it requires unusual
insight to distinguish the playful parts of a
letter from the serious passages. If the separated
lovers would escape the pit of destruction,
let all jokes be plainly marked with
a cross or a star.</p>

<p>A letter is an unfair thing. It follows its
own mood blindly without reference to
others. If penned in sadness it often makes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
a sunny day a cloudy one, and if written
in jest it may be as inopportune as mirth at a
funeral.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Misunderstood</div>

<p>A letter betraying anger and hurt pride
may often crystallise a yielding mood into
determination and summon evil spirits which
love cannot banish. The letter asking forgiveness
may cross the path of the one which
puts an end to everything. It would seriously
test the power of the Egyptian to foretell
what might result from a single letter, written
in all love and tenderness, perhaps, but destined
to be completely misunderstood.</p>

<p>Old love letters often mean tears, because
they have been so wrongly read. Later years,
with fine irony, sometimes bring new understanding
of the loving heart behind the faulty
lines. After all, it is the inexpressible atmosphere
of a letter which is felt, rather than the
meaning which the phrases ostensibly convey.</p>


<div class="sidenote">The
Postman</div>

<p>Tender secrets are concealed in the weather-worn
bag of the postman. The lovers may
hide their hearts from all but him. Parents,
guardians, and even mature maiden aunts
may be successfully diverted, but not the
postman!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>

<p>He knows that the girl who eagerly watches
for him in the morning has more than a passing
interest in the mail. He knows where
her lover is, how often he writes, when she
should have a letter, and whether all is well.</p>

<p>Sometimes, too, he knows that it is better
to take a single letter to the house three or
four times in succession, rather than to leave
it in the hands of one to whom it is not
addressed.</p>

<p>Blessed be the countless Cupids in the uniform
of the postal service! The little blind
god is wont to assume strange forms, apparently
at will. But no stern parent could
suspect that his sightless eyes were concealed
behind the spectacles of a sedate postman,
nor that his wicked arrows were hidden under
piles of letters.</p>

<p>The uninitiated wonder "what there is to
write about." A man may have seen a girl
the evening before, and yet a bulky letter
comes in the afternoon. And what mysterious
interest can make one write three or four
times a week?</p>

<p>Where is the girl whose love letter was left
in pawn because she could not find her purse?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
The grizzled veteran never collects the "two
cents due" on the love letters that are a little
overweight. He would not put a value upon
anything so precious, and he is seldom a
cynic&mdash;perhaps because, more than anyone
else, he is the dispenser of daily joy.</p>

<p>The reading of old love letters is in some
way associated with hair-cloth trunks, mysterious
attics, and rainy days. The writers
may be unknown and the hands that laid
them away long since returned to dust, but
the interest still remains.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dead
Roses</div>

<p>Dead roses crumble to ashes in the gentle
fingers that open the long folded pages&mdash;the
violets of a forgotten spring impart a delicate
fragrance to the yellowed spot on which
they lay. The ink is faded and the letter
much worn, as though it had lain next to
some youthful breast, to be read in silence
and solitude until the tender words were
graven upon the heart in the exquisite script
of Memory.</p>

<p>The phrasing has a peculiar quaintness, old
fashioned, perhaps, but with a grace and dignity
all its own. Through the formal, stately
sentences the hidden sweetness creeps like<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
the crimson vine upon the autumn leaves.
Brave hearts they had, those lovers of the
past, who were making a new country in the
wilderness, and yet there was an unsuspected
softness&mdash;the other "soul side" which even
a hero may have, "to show a woman when
he loves her."</p>

<p>There are other treasures to be found with
the letters&mdash;old daguerreotypes, in ornate
cases, showing the girlish, sweet face of her
who is a grandmother now, or perhaps a
soldier in the trappings of war, the first of a
valiant line.</p>

<p>There are songs which are never sung, save
as a quavering lullaby to some mite who will
never remember the tune, and fragments of
nocturnes or simple melodies, which awaken
the past as surely as the lost shell brings
to the traveller inland the surge and thunder
of the distant sea.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Mysteries
of
Life and
Death</div>

<p>All the mysteries of life and death are
woven in with the letters; those pathetic
remembrances which the years may fade but
never destroy. There are old school books,
dog-eared and musty, scraps of rich brocade
and rustling taffeta, the yellowed sampler<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
which was the daily trial of some little maid,
and the first white robe of someone who
has grown children of his own.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Memory's
Singing</div>

<p>Give Memory an old love letter and listen
to her singing. There is quiet at first, as
though she were waiting for some step to
die away, or some childish laughter to cease.
Then there is a hushed arpeggio, struck from
strings which are old and worn, but sweet
and tender still.</p>

<p>Sometimes the song is of an old farmhouse
on the western plains, where life meant struggle
and bitter privation. Brothers and sisters,
in the torn, faded clothes which were all they
had; father's tremulous "God bless you,"
when someone went away. Mother's never-ending
toil, and the day when her roughened
hands were crossed upon her breast, at rest
for the first time, while the children cried in
wonder and fear.</p>

<p>Then the plaintive minor swells for a moment
into the full major chord, when Love,
the King, in royal purple, took possession of
the desolate land. Corn huskings and the
sound of "Money Musk," scarlet ears and
stolen kisses under the harvest moon, youth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
and laughter, and the eternal, wavering hope
for better things. Long years of toil, with
interludes of peace and divine content, little
voices, and sometimes a little grave. Separation
and estrangement, trust and misgiving,
heartache and defeat.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Magic
in the
Strings</div>

<p>The tears may start at Memory's singing,
but as the song goes on there comes peace,
for there is a magic in the strings which
changes sadness into something sweet.
Memory's eyes are deep and tender and her
heart is full of compassion. So the old love

<h2 style="color: red;">An Inquiry into Marriage</h2>


<div class="sidenote">Like a
Grape</div>

<p>Marriage appears to be somewhat like
a grape. People swallow a great deal
of indifferent good for the sake of the lurking
bit of sweetness and never know until it is
too late whether the venture was wise.</p>

<p>Chaucer compared it to a crowded church.
Those left on the outside are eager to get in,
and those caught inside are straining every
nerve to get out. There are many, in this
year of grace, who have safely made their
escape, but, unfortunately, the happy ones
inside say little about it, and do not seem
anxious to get out.</p>

<p>Fate takes great pleasure in confusing the
inquiring spinster. Some of the disappointed
ones will advise her never to attempt it, and
in the voluble justification which follows, she
sees clearly that the discord was not entirely
caused by the other. Her friends, who have
been married a year or so, regard her with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
evident pity, and occasionally suggest, delicately
enough, to be sure, that she could
never have had a proposal.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Consistent
Lady</div>

<p>Among her married friends who are more
mature, there is usually one who chooses her
for a confidant. This consistent lady will sob
out her unhappiness on the girl's shoulder,
and the next week ask her why she doesn't
get married. Sometimes she invites the girl
to her house to meet some new and attractive
man&mdash;with the memory of those bitter tears
still in her heart.</p>

<p>A girl often loses a friend by heartily endorsing
the things the weeper says of her
husband. The fact that he is an inconsiderate
brute is frequently confided to the kindly
surface of a clean shirt-waist, regardless of
laundry bills. The girl remarks dispassionately
that she has noticed it; that he never
considers the happiness of his wife, and she
doesn't see how the tearful one stands it.
Behold the instant and painful transformation!
It is very hard to be a popular spinster when
one has many married friends.</p>

<p>That interesting pessimist, Herr Arthur
Schopenhauer, advocates universal polygamy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
upon the theory that all women would thus
be supported. To the unprejudiced observer
who reads the comic papers and goes to afternoon
receptions, it would seem that each
woman should have several husbands, to pay
her bills and see that she is suitably escorted
to various social affairs.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Seven
Husbands</div>

<p>If a woman had seven husbands, for instance,
it is possible that some one of them
would be willing to take her out whenever
she wanted to go. If she yearned for a sealskin
coat or a diamond pin and no one of them
was equal to the occasion, a collection could
be taken up. Two or three might contribute
to the good cause and be so beautifully rewarded
with smiles and favourite dishes that
the remainder of the husbands would be inspired
to do something in the same line.</p>

<p>At least five of them could go out every
night in the week. The matter could be arranged
according to a simple system of rotation,
or they might draw lots. There could
be a club-room in the house, where they
might smoke without affecting the curtains
and Madam's temper. Politics and poker
make more widows than war, but no woman<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
could find it in her heart to object to the innocent
pastime under such happy circumstances,
because she would be deprived of nothing&mdash;not
even her husband's society. Six of them
might play, while the other read to their wife,
and those who won could buy some lovely
new china for the house.</p>

<p>The sweetness of the lady of their several
hearts would be increased seven-fold, while
her frowns would be equally divided among
them. There would be a large and enviable
freedom accorded everyone. There would
always be enough at home so dinner need not
wait, and Madam would be spared one great
annoyance. If the servants left suddenly, as is
not unusual, there would be men enough to
cook a dinner Epicurus might envy, each one
using his own chafing-dish. Men make better
cooks than women because they put so much
more feeling into it.</p>

<p>The spirit of gentle rivalry, which would
thus be developed, is well worth considering.
Some one of the seven would always be a
lover. To sustain the old relation continuously
after marriage undoubtedly requires
gifts of tact and temperament which are not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
often vouchsafed to men, and this would not
prove so irksome if the tender obligation were
shared. Marriage would no longer be the
cold potato of love.</p>

<p>Different men always admire different qualities
of the same woman, and the beauty of
the much-married lady would be developed
far beyond that of her who had only one husband,
because a recognised virtue is stimulated.</p>

<p>If a man admires a woman's teeth, she gets
new kinds of dentifrice and constantly endeavours
to add to their whiteness. If he
speaks approvingly of her hair, various tonics
are purchased. If he alludes to her mellow
voice, she tries conscientiously to make it
more beautiful still.</p>

<p>There is a suspected but not verified relation
between a man's affection and his digestion.
With this ideal method of marriage in force,
the dyspeptics could go off by themselves until
they felt better, and not be bothered with
tender inquiries concerning their health. If
the latch key unaccountably refused to work
at two o'clock in the morning, some other
member of the husband could always assist<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
the absent ones in, and Madam would never
know how many were late.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Financial
Burden</div>

<p>The financial burden would indeed be light.
The household expenses might be divided
equally and relieving the wife's necessities
would be the happiness of all. One might
assume the responsibility of her gowns,
another of her hats and gloves, another might
keep her supplied with bonbons, matin&eacute;e tickets,
flowers, and silk stockings, another might
attend to her jackets and her club dues, her jewels
might be the care of another, and so on. It
would be the joy of all of them to see their peerless
wife well dressed, and when she wanted
anything in particular, she need only smile
sweetly upon the one whose happy lot it was
to have charge of that department of expense.</p>

<p>There would be no friction, no discord.
Madam would be blissfully content, and men
have claimed for years that they could live
together much more amicably than women,
and that they never quarrel among themselves,
save in rare instances. This, they say, is because
they are so liberal in their views, but a
great many men are so broad-minded that it
makes their heads flat.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>

<p>It is strange that this happy form of polygamy
did not occur to Herr Schopenhauer. It
may be because he was a pessimist&mdash;and a
man.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Most
Nervous
Time</div>

<p>The most nervous time of a man's life is
the day of his wedding. The bachelors and
benedicts give different reasons for this when
they are gently approached upon the subject,
but the majority admit, with lovable and refreshing
conceit, that it is because of their
innate modesty and their aversion to conspicuous
prominence.</p>

<p>If this is truly the reason, the widespread
fear may be much lessened, for in the grand
matrimonial pageant, the man is the most obscure
member of the procession. People are
not apt to think of him at all until the ceremony
is over and the girl has a new name.
What he wears is of no consequence, and he
has no wedding gifts, though he may be remembered
for a moment if he gives a diamond
star to the bride. Yet it is this ceremony
which changes him from a vassal to a king.
Before marriage he is a low and useless trump,
but afterward he is ace high in the game.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Trip
Down
Town</div>

<p>A latter-day philosopher has beautifully<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
likened marriage to a trip down-town. A
man leaves the house in the morning, his
mind already active concerning the affairs of
the day. His newspaper is in his pocket,
he has plenty of time to reach the office,
and his breakfast has begun to assimilate.
Suddenly he sees a yellow speck on the
horizon.</p>

<p>He calculates the distance to the corner and
quickens his pace, his eyes nobly fixed meanwhile
upon the goal of his ambition. Anxiety
develops, then fear. At last he surrenders all
dignity and gallops madly toward the approaching
car, with his coat tails spread to
the morning breeze and tears in his eyes.
Out of breath, but triumphant, he swings
on just as farther pursuit seemed well-nigh
hopeless.</p>

<p>Does he stop to chat cheerily with the conductor?
Does he dwell upon the luxurious
aspect of his conveyance? Does the comfort
which he has just secured fill his heart with
gladness? Does the plush covering of the
seat appeal to his &aelig;sthetic sense? No mere
woman may ever hope to know, for he grudgingly
gives the conductor five pennies, one of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
them badly battered and the date beaten out
of it&mdash;and devotes himself to his paper.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Masculine
Mental
Process</div>

<p>The thing which appears unattainable is
ever desired by man. A girl who wears
an engagement ring upon her finger has a
charm for which the unattached sigh in vain.
The masculine mental process in such a
case, briefly summarised, is something like
this.</p>

<p>I. "Wonder who that girl is over there?
Red hair and quite a bit of style. Never cared
much for red hair&mdash;suppose she's got freckles
too. Now she's coming this way. Why,
there's a solitaire on her finger; she's engaged.
Well, he can have her&mdash;I won't cut
him out. Wonder who she is!</p>

<p>II. "Really, she isn't so bad&mdash;I've seen
worse. She knows how to dress, and she
hasn't so many freckles. Brown eyes&mdash;that
means temper when associated with red hair.
Must be quite a little trick to tame a girl like
that. She doesn't look as though she were
quite subdued.</p>

<p>III. "He probably doesn't know how to
manage her. I could train her all right. I
wouldn't mind doing it; I haven't anything<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
much on hand in the girl line. So that's the
cad she's engaged to? Poor little girl!</p>

<p>IV. "I feel sorry for that girl, I honestly do.
She's throwing herself away. She can't love
that fellow. She'll get over it when she's
married, and be miserable all the rest of her
life. I suppose I ought to save her from him.
I think I'll talk to her about it, but it will
have to be done cautiously.</p>

<p>V. "Fine young woman, that. Broad-minded,
bright, vivacious, and not half bad
to look at. Seemed to take my advice in
good part. Those great, deep brown eyes
are pathetic. That's the kind of a girl to be
shielded and guarded from all the hard knocks
in the world.</p>

<p>VI. "The more I see of that girl, the more
I think of her. Those Frenchy touches of
dress and that superb red hair make her beautiful.
I always did like red hair. Honestly, I
think she's the prettiest girl I ever saw.
And her womanliness matches her beauty.
Any man might be proud of winning a girl
like that.</p>

<p>VII. "The irony of Fate! The one soul in
all the universe that is deep enough to com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>prehend
mine, the peerless queen of womankind,
she for whom I have waited all my life,
is pledged to another! I shall go mad if I
bear this any longer. I simply must have
her. 'All is fair in love and war'&mdash;I'll go
and ask her!"</p>

<div class="sidenote">Gold-Brick
Tactics</div>

<p>When one man alludes to another as a
"confidence man," it is no distinguishing
mark, for they instinctively adopt gold-brick
tactics when seeking woman in marriage.</p>

<p>Those exquisite hands shall never perform a
single menial task! Yet, after marriage, Her
Ladyship finds that she is expected to be a
cook, nurse, housekeeper, seamstress, chambermaid,
waitress, and practical plumber.
This is an unconscious tribute to the versatility
of woman, since a man thinks he does
well if he is a specialist in any one line.</p>

<p>Her slightest wish shall be his law! Yet
not only are wishes of no avail, but even
pleading and prayer fall upon deaf ears. It
will be his delight to see that she wants for
nothing, yet she is reduced to the necessity of
asking for money&mdash;even for carfare&mdash;and a
man will do for his bicycle what his wife
would ask in vain.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>

<p>Many of the matrimonial infelicities of which
both men and women bitterly complain may
be traced to the gold-brick delusion. A woman
marries in the hope of having a lover
and discovers, too late, that she merely has a
boarder who is most difficult to please.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A
Certain
Pitiful
Change</div>

<p>There is a certain pitiful change which
comes with marriage. The sound of her
voice would thrill him to his finger-tips, the
touch of her hand make his throat ache, and
the light in her eyes set the blood to singing
in his veins. With possession, ecstasy
changes to content, and the loving woman,
dreaming that she may again find what she
has so strangely lost, tries to waken the old
feeling by pathetic little ways which women
read at once, but men never know anything
about.</p>

<p>In a way, woman is to blame, but not so
much. Her superior insight should give her
a better understanding of courtship. A man
may mean what he says&mdash;at the time he says
it&mdash;but men and seasons change.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Value
and Proportion</div>

<p>The happiness of the after-years depends
largely upon her sense of value and proportion.
No woman of artistic judgment would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
crowd her rooms with bric-&agrave;-brac, even
though comfort were not lacking. Pictures
hung together so closely that the frames
touch lose beauty. Space has distinct value,
and solid colours, judiciously used, create a
harmony impossible to obtain by the continuous
use of figured fabrics.</p>

<p>Yet many a woman whose house is a
model of taste, whose rooms are spacious
and restful, insists upon crowding her marriage
with the bric-&agrave;-brac of violent affection. She
is not content with undecorated spaces; with
interludes of friendship and the appreciation
which is felt, rather than spoken. She demands
the constant assurances, the unfailing
devotion of the lover, and thus loses her
atmosphere&mdash;and her content.</p>

<p>It seems to be a settled thing that men shall
do the courting before marriage and women
afterward. Nobody writes articles on "How
to Make a Wife Happy," and the innumerable
cook books, like an army of grasshoppers,
consume and devastate the land.</p>

<p>If women did not demand so much, men in
general would be more thoughtful. If it were
understood that even after marriage man was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
still to be the lover, the one who sent roses
to his sweetheart would sometimes bring them
to his wife. The pretty courtesies would not
so often be forgotten.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Tender
Thought</div>

<p>If the tender thought were in some way
shown, and the loving word which leaps to
the lips were never forced back, but always
spoken, marriage and even life itself would
take on new beauty and charm. If a woman
has daily evidence of a man's devotion,
no matter in how small a way, her
hunger and thirst for love are bountifully
assuaged. Misunderstandings rapidly grow
into coldness and neglect, and foolish woman,
blind with love, adopts retribution and recrimination
as her weapons. There are a
great many men who love their wives simply
because they know they would be scalped if
they didn't.</p>

<p>Making an issue of a little thing is one of
the surest ways to spoil happiness. One's
personal pride is felt to be vitally injured by
surrender, but there is no quality of human
nature so nearly royal as the ability to yield
gracefully. It shows small confidence in one's
own nature to fear that compromise lessens<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
self-control. To consider constantly the comfort
and happiness of another is not a sign of
weakness but of strength.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Spoiled
Children</div>

<p>Too many men and women are only spoiled
children at heart. The little maid of five or
six takes her doll and goes home because her
playmates have been unkind. Twenty years
later she packs her trunk and goes to her
mother's because of some quarrel which had
an equally childish beginning.</p>

<p>But the hurts of the after-years are not so
easily healed. The children kiss and make
up no later than the next day, but, grown to
manhood and womanhood, they consider it
far beneath their dignity and importance to
say "Forgive me," and thus proceed to the
matrimonial garbage box by way of the
divorce court.</p>

<p>Lovers are wont to consider a marriage
license a free ticket to Paradise. Sometimes
happiness may be freely given by the dispenser
of earthly blessings, but it is more
often bought. It is a matter of temperament
rather than circumstance, and is to be had
only by the two who work for it together,
forgiving, forgetting, graciously yielding, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
looking forward to the perfect understanding
which will surely come.</p>

<p>Matches are not all made in heaven. Even
the parlour variety sometimes smell of brimstone,
and Cupid is blamed for many which
are made by cupidity. The gossips and the
busybodies would die of mal-nutrition were
it not for marriage and its complications.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Tabbies</div>

<p>Two people who have quarrelled cheerfully
before marriage and whose engagement has
been broken three or four times often surprise
the tabbies who prophesy misfortune
by settling down into post-nuptial content.
Two who are universally pronounced to be
"perfectly suited to each other" are soon
absolutely miserable. Marriage is the one
thing which everyone knows more about
than people who are intimately concerned.</p>

<div class="sidenote">"Unequal
Marriages"</div>

<p>We hear a great deal of "unequal marriages,"
not merely in degree of fortune, but
in taste and mental equipment. A man
steeped to his finger-tips in the lore of the
ancients chooses a pretty butterfly who does
not know the difference between a hieroglyph
and a Greek verb, and to whom Rome and
Carthage are empty names. His friends pre<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>dict
misery, and wonder at his blindness in
passing by the young woman of equal outward
charm who delivered a scholarly thesis
at her commencement and has the degree of
Master of Arts.</p>

<p>A talented woman marries a man without
proportionate gifts and the tabbies call a special
session. It is decided at this conclave
that "she is throwing herself away and will
regret it." To everyone's surprise, she is
occasionally very happy with the man she
has chosen, though about some things of no
particular importance she knows much more
than he.</p>

<p>The law of compensation is as certain in its
action as that of gravitation, though it is
not so widely understood. Nature demands
balance and equality. She is constantly
chiselling at the mountain to lower it to the
level of the plain, and welding heterogeneous
elements into homogeneous groups.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Certain
Instinct</div>

<p>The pretty butterfly may easily prove a
balance wheel to the man of much wisdom.
She will add a vivid human interest to his abstract
pursuits and keep him from growing
narrow-minded. He chose the element he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
needed to make him symmetrical, with the
certain instinct which impels isolated atoms
of hydrogen and oxygen to combine in the
proportion of two to one.</p>

<p>It never occurs to the tabbies that no talent
or facility can ever stifle a woman's nature.
The simple need of her heart is never taken
into account in the criticism of these marriages
which are deemed "unequal." If a
woman holds an assistant professorship of
mathematics in a university, it is a foregone
conclusion that she should fall in love with
someone who is proficient in trigonometry
and holds his tangents and cosines in high
esteem. Happy evenings could then be spent
with a book of logarithms and sheets of paper
specially cut to accommodate a problem.</p>

<p>Similarity of tastes may sometimes prove
an attraction, but very seldom similarity of
pursuit. Musicians do not often intermarry,
and artists and writers are more apt to choose
each other than exponents of their own cult.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Appreciation
and
Accomplishment</div>

<p>It is not surprising if a man who is passionately
fond of music falls in love with a woman
who has a magnificent voice, or a power
which amounts to magic over the strings of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
her violin. Appreciation is as essential to
happiness as accomplishment, and when the
two are balanced in marriage, comradeship is
inevitable. An artist may marry a woman
who does not understand his pictures, but if
she had not appreciated him in ways more
vital to his happiness, there would have been
no marriage.</p>

<p>It is pathetic to see what marriage sometimes
is, compared with what it might be&mdash;to
see it degraded to the level of a business
transaction when it was meant to be infinitely
above the sordid touch of the dollar and the
dime. It is a perverted instinct which leads
one to marry for money, for it will not buy
happiness, though it may secure an imitation
which pleases some people for a little while.</p>

<p>There is nothing so beautiful as a girl's
dream of her marriage, and nothing so sad as
the same girl, if Time brings her disillusion
instead of the true marriage which is "a
mutual concord and agreement of souls, a
harmony in which discord is not even
imagined; the uniting of two mornings that
hope to reach the night together."</p>

<p>The world is full of pain and danger for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
those who face it alone, and home, that sanctuary
where one may find strength and new
courage, must be built upon a foundation of
mutual helpfulness and trust. No one can
make a home alone. It needs a man's strong
hands, a woman's tender hands, and two true
hearts.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Light
upon the
Altar</div>

<p>The light which shines upon the bridal altar
is either the white flame of eternal devotion
or the sacrificial fire which preys hungrily
upon someone's disappointment and someone's
broken heart. But to the utter rout
of the cynic, the dream which led the two
souls thither sometimes becomes divinely true.</p>

<p>Marriage is said to be sufficient "career"
for any woman, and it is equally true of men.
Like Emerson's vision of friendship, it is fit
"not only for serene days and pleasant rambles,
but for all the passages of life and death."</p>

<p>It is to make one the stronger because one
does not have to go alone. It is to make
one's joy the sweeter because it is shared.
It is to take the sting away from grief because
it is divided, and the dear comfort of the other's
love lies forever around the sore and doubting
heart.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Fire and
Snow</div>

<p>It is to be the light in the darkness, the belief
in the distrust, the never-failing source of
consolation. It is to be the gentlest of forgiveness
for all of one's mistakes&mdash;strength
and tenderness, passion and purity, the fire
and the snow.</p>

<p>It is to make one generous to all the world
with one's sympathy and compassion, because
in the sanctuary there is no lack of love. It
is "the joining together of two souls for life,
to strengthen each other in all peril, to rest
on each other in all sorrow, to minister to
each other in all pain, to be one with each
other in silent, unspeakable memories at the
moment of the last parting."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span></p>

<h2 style="color: red;">The Physiology of Vanity</h2>


<div class="sidenote">Conceit
and
Vanity</div>

<p>"Vanity of vanities, all is vanity!" It
is the common human emotion, the
root of the personal equation, the battling
residuum in the last analysis of social chemistry.
There is a wide difference between
conceit and vanity. Conceit is lovable and
unconcealed; vanity is supreme selfishness,
usually hidden. Conceit is based upon an
unselfish desire to please; vanity takes no
thought of others which is not based upon
egotism.</p>

<p>Vanity and jealousy are closely allied, while
conceit is a natural development of altruistic
virtue. Conceit is the mildest of vices; vanity
is the worst. Men are usually conceited
but infrequently vain, while women are seldom
afflicted with the lesser vice.</p>

<p>Man's conceit is the simplest form of self-appreciation.
He thinks he is extremely
good-looking, as men go; that he has seen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
the world; that he is a good judge of dinners
and of human nature; that he is one of the
few men who may easily charm a woman.</p>

<p>The limits of man's conceit are usually in
full view, but eye nor opera-glass has not yet
approached the end of woman's vanity. The
disease is contagious, and the men who suffer
from it are usually those whose chosen companions
are women.</p>

<p>Woman's vanity is a development of her
insatiate thirst for love. Her smiles and tears
are all-powerful with her lover, and nothing
goes so quickly to a woman's head as a sense
of power. She forever defies the Salic law&mdash;each
woman feels that her rightful place is
upon a throne.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The One
Object</div>

<p>The one object of woman's life is the acquirement
of power through love. It is because
this power is freely recognised by the
men who seek her in marriage that her vanity
seldom has full scope until after she is married.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Destroyer</div>

<p>After marriage, a great many women begin
the slow process of alienating a man from his
family, blind to the fact that by lessening his
love for others, they add nothing to their own
store. The filial and fraternal love is not to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
be given to anyone but mother and sisters&mdash;they
have no place in a man's heart that another
woman could fill. The destroyer simply
obliterates that part of his life and offers
nothing in its place.</p>

<p>The achievement sometimes takes years,
but it is none the less sure. Later, it may be
extended to father and brothers, but they are
always the last to be considered.</p>

<p>It is most difficult of all to break the tie
which binds a man to his mother. The one
who bore him is not faultless, for motherhood
brings new gifts of feeling, sometimes sacrificing
judgment and clear vision to selfish unselfishness.
It is only in fiction and poetry
that such love is valued now, for the divine
blindness which does not question, which
asks only the right to give, has lost beauty in
our age of reason and restraint.</p>

<p>He had thought that face the most beautiful
in all the world&mdash;until he fell in love.
Now he sees his mother as she is; a wrinkled
old woman, perverse, unreasonable, and inclined
to meddle with his domestic affairs.
The hands that soothed his childish fretting
are no longer lovely. Inattention to small<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
details of dress, which he never noticed before,
are painfully evident. The eyes that have
watched him all his life with loving anxiety,
shining with pride at his success and softening
with tenderest pity at his mistakes, are
subtly different now. He wonders at his
blindness. It is strange, indeed, that he has
not realised all this before.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Awakening</div>

<p>To most men the awakening comes too
late if it comes at all. Only when the faded
eyes are closed and the worn hands folded forever;
when "mother" is beyond the reach of
praise or blame, her married boy realises what
has been done. With that first shock comes
bitterest repentance&mdash;and he never forgives
his wife. Many a woman who complains of
"coldness" and "lost love" might trace it
back to the day her husband's mother died,
and to the sudden flash of insight, the adjustment
of relation, which comes with death.</p>

<p>The comic papers have made the mother-in-law
a thing to be dreaded. She is the
poster attached to the matrimonial magazine
which inspires would-be purchasers with awe.
Many an engaged girl confides to her best
friend that her fianc&eacute;'s mother is "an old<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
cat." She usually goes still further, and gives
jealousy as the cause of it.</p>

<p>No right-minded mother was ever jealous
of the woman her son chose for his wife.
But she has seen how marriage changes men
and naturally fears the result. The altar is
the grave of many a boy's love for his mother.
Neither of the women most intimately concerned
is blind to the impending possibilities;
it is only man who cannot see.</p>

<div class="sidenote">One in a
Thousand</div>

<p>There are some girls who realise what it
means, but they are few and far between.
One in a thousand, perhaps, will openly acknowledge
her debt to the woman who for
twenty-five or thirty years has given her best
thought to the man she is about to marry.</p>

<p>Is he strong and active, healthy and finely
moulded? It is his mother's care for the first
sixteen years of his life. It is the result of
her anxious days and of many a sleepless
night, while the potential man was racked
with fever and childish ills. His chivalrous
devotion to the girl he loves is wholly due to
his mother's influence. His clean and open-hearted
manliness is a free gift to her, from
the woman now characterised as "an old cat."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></p>

<p>It is seldom that the mother receives credit
for his virtues, but she is invariably blamed for
his faults. Too many women expect a man
to be cut out by their pattern. The supreme
mental achievement is the ability to judge
other people by their own standards, and a
crank is not necessarily a person whose rules of
life and conduct do not coincide with our own.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Thirst for
Power</div>

<p>To this thirst for power may be traced all
of woman's vanity. It is commonly supposed
that she dresses to please others, but she
often values fine raiment principally because
it shows how much her husband thinks of
her. If a man's coat is shiny at the seams
and he postpones the new one that his wife
may have an extra hat, she is delicately
flattered by this unselfish tribute to her charm.</p>

<p>From a single root vanity spreads and flowers
until its poisonous blooms affect all social
life. A woman becomes vain of her house,
her rugs, her tapestries, her jewels, horses,
and even of the livery of her footman.
The things which should be valued for their
intrinsic beauty and the pleasure-giving quality,
which is not by any means selfish, soon
become food for a vice.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>

<p>She gradually grows to consider herself a
very superior person. She is so charming
and so much to be desired, that some man
works night and day in his office, sacrificing
both pleasure and rest, that she may have the
baubles for which she yearns.</p>

<p>It is not far from absolute self-satisfaction,
in either man or woman, to generous bestowal
of enlightenment upon the unfortunate
savages who linger on the outskirts of one's
social sphere.</p>

<p>In the infinite vastness of creation, where
innumerable worlds move according to the
fiat of majestic Law, there lies one called
Earth. There are planets within reach of the
scientific vision of its inhabitants that are
many times larger. There are some which
have more moons, more mountains and rivers,
longer days, and longer years. Countless
suns, the centres of other vast planetary systems,
lie in the inconceivable distances beyond.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Mote in
the Sun</div>

<p>In the midst of this unspeakable greatness,
Earth swings like one of the motes which a
passing sunbeam illumines. Upon this mote,
one fifth of the inhabitants have assumed
supreme knowledge and understanding, given<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
them, doubtless, because of their innate superiority.
This preferment, also, is theirs by
the grace of an infinitely just and merciful
God.</p>

<p>The other four fifths are supposedly in total
darkness, though the same heavens are over
their heads, the same earth under their feet,
and though the light of sun and moon and the
gentle radiance of the stars are freely given to
all.</p>

<p>There are the same opportunities for development
and civilisation, but they have not
received The Enlightenment. To them must
go the foreign missionaries, to teach the things
which have been graciously given them on
account of their innate superiority.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Narrowing
Circles</div>

<p>Man's life is a succession of narrowing
circles. He admits the force of the heliocentric
idea, for it is the sun which gives light
and heat. Then the circle narrows, almost
imperceptibly, for, of all the planets which
circle around the sun, is not Earth the chief?</p>

<p>This point being gained, he is inside the
geocentric circle. Earth is the centre of creation.
Sun, moon, and stars are auxiliary
forces, bountifully arranged by the Giver of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
all Good for Earth's beauty and comfort. Of
all the creatures who share in this, is not man
the most important? Thus he retreats to the
anthropocentric circle.</p>

<div class="sidenote">By
Strength
of Mind
and Arm</div>

<p>Man is the centre of organic life, and it is
easily seen that his race is far superior to the
others. Their skins are not the same colour,
their ships are not so mighty, their cunning
with weapons is infinitely less. His race is
dominant by strength of mind and arm.</p>

<p>The dark-skinned races must be taught
civilisation, with fire and sword, with cannon
and bayonet, with crime and death. They
must be civilised before they can be happy.
The naked savage who sits beneath a palm
tree, with his hut in the distance, while his
wife and children hover around him, is happy
only because he is too ignorant to know what
happiness is.</p>

<p>In order to be rightly happy, he must have
a fine house, carriages, and servants, and live
in a crowded city where tall buildings and
smoke limit one's horizon to a narrow patch
of blue. He must struggle daily with his
fellows, not for the necessaries of life, but
for small pieces of silver and bits of green<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
paper, which are not nearly as pretty as glass
beads.</p>

<p>The savage, unaccustomed to refinement,
stabs or beheads his enemy. Civilisation will
teach him the uses of poison, and that putting
typhoid germs into the drinking water of an
Emperor is much more delicate and fully as
effectual.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Sublime
Egotism</div>

<p>From this small circle, it is only a step to
the centre and to that sublime egotism which
has been named Vanity.</p>

<p>Man repeats in his own life the development
of a nation. He progresses from unquestioning
happiness to childish inquiry and wonder,
from fairy tales of princes and dragons to
actual knowledge; through inquiry to doubt,
through faith to disbelief, through civilisation
to decay.</p>

<p>He is not content to let other nations and
others races pursue their normal development.
He insists that the work of centuries be
crowded into a generation. And in the same
manner, the growth and strivings of his fellows
call forth his unselfish aid. Having infinite
treasures of mental equipment, gained
by superior opportunity and wider experience,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
he will generously share his noble possessions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Personal
Vanity</div>

<p>It is personal vanity of the most flagrant
type which intrudes itself, unasked, into other
people's affairs. There are few of us who do
not feel capable of ordering the daily lives of
others, down to the most minute detail.</p>

<p>We know how their houses should be arranged,
how they should spend and invest
their money, how they should dress, how
they should comport themselves, and more
definitely yet do we know the things they
should not do. We know what is right and
what is wrong, while they, poor things! do
not. We know whom and when they should
marry, how their children should be educated
and trained, and what servants they should
employ.</p>

<p>We know for what pursuit each one is best
fitted and how each should occupy his spare
time. We know to what church all should
go; what creed all should believe. We know
what particular traits are faults and how these
can be corrected. We know so much about
other people that we often have not time to
give due attention to ourselves. We neglect<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
our own affairs that we may unselfishly direct
others, and sometimes suffer in consequence,
for nobody but a lawyer makes a good living
by attending to other people's business.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Theoretically</div>

<p>Theoretically, this should be pleasing to
each one. Every person of sense should be
delighted at being told just what to do. It
would relieve him from all care, all responsibility;
the necessity for thought, planning,
and individual judgment would be wholly
removed.</p>

<p>The musical student would not have to select
his own instrument, his own teacher, nor
even his own practice time. Every author
would know just how and when to write,
and in order to become famous, he need only
act upon the suggestions for stories and improvement
of style which are gratuitously
given him from day to day, by people who
cannot write a clear and correct sentence.
This thing actually happened; consequently
it is just the theme for fiction. This plot,
suitably developed, would make the nations
sit up, and send the race by hundred thousands
to the corner bookstore.</p>

<p>The cares incident to selecting a wardrobe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
would be wholly removed. Every woman
knows how every other should dress. Her
sure taste selects at a glance the thing which
will best become the other, and over which
the Unenlightened may ponder for hours.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Common
Vanity</div>

<p>There is no more common vanity than
claiming to "know" some particular person.
We are "all things to all men." The two
who love each other better than all the world
beside, have much knowledge, but it is not
by any means complete. "Souls reach out to
each other across the impassable gulfs of individual
being." And yet, daily, people who
have no sympathy with us, and scarcely a
common interest, will assume to "know" us,
when we do not fully know ourselves, and
when we earnestly hide our real selves from
all save the single soul we love.</p>

<p>To assume intimate knowledge of the hundred
considerations which make up a single
situation, the various complexities of temperament
and disposition which the personal equation
continually produces in human affairs, of
the imperceptible fibres of the web which lies
between two souls, preventing always the fullest
understanding, unless Love, the magician,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
gives new sight&mdash;amounts to the proclamation
of practical Omnipotence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">"I Told
You So"</div>

<p>There is no position in life which is secure.
No complication ever comes to our friends,
which our advice, acted upon, would not immediately
solve. If our most minute directions
are not thankfully received and put into
effect, there is always the comforting indication
of superiority&mdash;"I told you so."</p>

<p>And when the jaded soul revolts in supreme
defiance, declaring its right to its own life, its
own duties, its own friendships, and its own
loves, there is much expressed disgust, much
misfortune predicted, and, saddest of all, much
wounded vanity.</p>

<p>The dominant egotism forbids that anything
shall be better than itself. No success is comparable
to one's own, no life so wisely ordered,
and there is nothing so sad as the fame
attained by those who do not follow our
advice.</p>

<p>Adversity is commonly accepted as the test
of friendship, but there is another more certain
still&mdash;success. Anyone may bestow
pity. It is fatally easy to offer to those less
fortunate than ourselves; whose capabilities<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
have not proved adequate, as ours have; but it
requires fine gifts of generous feeling to be genuinely
glad at another's good fortune, in which
we cannot by any possibility hope to share.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Advice</div>

<p>Advice is usually to be had for the asking.
In the case of a corporation attorney or a
specialist, there is a high value placed upon
it, but it is to be freely had from those who
love us, and, strangely enough, from those
who do not.</p>

<p>It is one of the blessings of love, that all
the experience of another, all the battles of
the other soul, are laid open for our better
understanding of our own path. But there is
a subtle distinction between the counsel of
love and that of vanity. The one is unselfishly
glad of our achievements, taking new
delight in every step upward, while the other
passes over triumphs in silence and carps upon
the misfortune until it is not to be borne.</p>

<p>From the intimate union of two loving
souls, Vanity is forever shut out. Jealousy
dare not show her malignant face. These
two are facing the world together, side by
side and shoulder to shoulder, each the other's
strength and shield.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p>

<p>Success may come only after many failures;
the tide may not turn till after long discouragement
and great despair. But in the union
with that other soul, so gently baring its inmost
dream that the other may understand,
defeat loses its sting.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Sanctuary
of that
Other
Soul</div>

<p>Ambition forever beckons, like a will o' the
wisp. When realisation seems within easy
reach, the dream fades, or another, seemingly
unattainable, mockingly takes its place. But
in the sanctuary of that other soul, there is
always new courage to be found. Long
aisles and quiet spaces lessen the fever and
the unrest. Darkness and cool shadows soothe
the burning eyes, and in the clasp of those
loving arms there is certain sleep.</p>

<p>Vanity cares for nothing which is not in
some way its own, and it is perhaps an
amorphous vanity, as carbon is akin to a
diamond, that makes a hard-won victory
doubly dear.</p>

<p>There are always sycophants to fawn and
flatter, there are hands that will gladly help
that they may claim their share of the result,
but that realised dream is wholly sweet in
which only the dreamer and the other soul<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
have fully believed. Failure, even, is more
easily borne if it is entirely one's own; if there
is no one else to be blamed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Bitter
Proof</div>

<p>"Vanity of vanities, all is vanity." So
spake the prophet in Jerusalem and the centuries
have brought the bitter proof. Vanity
has reared palaces which have vanished like
the architecture of a mirage. Vanity has led
the hosts against itself.</p>

<p>Where are Babylon and Nineveh; the hanging
gardens and the splendour of forgotten
kings? Where are C&aelig;sar and Cleopatra; Trianon
and Marie Antoinette? Where is the
lordly Empire of France? Is it buried with
military honours, in the grave of the exiled
Napoleon?</p>

<p>Vanity's pomp endureth for a day, but Vanity
itself is perennial. Vanity sets whole races
of men in motion, pitting them against each
other across intervening seas.</p>

<p>One woman has a stone, no larger than a
pea, brought from a mine in South Africa.
Vanity sets it proudly upon her breast and
leads other women to envy her its possession,
for purely selfish reasons. One woman's
gown is made from a plant which grows in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
Georgia and she is unhappy because it is not
the product of a French or Japanese worm.</p>

<p>One woman's coat is woven from the covering
of a sheep, and she is not content because
it has not cost a greater number of silver
pieces and more bits of green paper, besides
the life of an Arctic seal, that never harmed
her nor hers.</p>

<p>Vanity allows a tender-hearted woman,
who cannot see a child or a dumb brute in
pain, to order the tails of her horses cut to the
fashionable length and to wear upon her hat
the pitiful little body of a song-bird that has
been skinned alive.</p>

<p>Vanity permits a woman to trim the outer
garments of the little stranger for whose coming
she has long waited and prayed, with
pretty, fluffy fur torn from the unborn baby of
another mother&mdash;who is only a sheep. Vanity
permits a woman to insist that her combs
and pins shall be real tortoise-shell, which is
obtained from the quivering animal by roasting
it alive before a slow fire.</p>

<div class="sidenote">All is
Vanity</div>

<p>"Vanity of vanities, all is vanity!" The
mad race still goes on. It is insatiate vanity
which wrecks lives, ruins homes, torments<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
one's fellows, and blinds the clear vision of its
victims. It harms others, but most of all
one's self.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Conqueror</div>

<p>There is only one place from which it is
shut out&mdash;from the union with that other
soul. Great as it is, there is still a greater
force; there is the inevitable conqueror, for
Vanity cannot exist side by side with Love.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span></p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2 style="color: red;">Widowers and Widows</h2>


<p>Next to burglars, mice, and green worms,
every normal girl fears a widow. Courtships
have been upset and expected proposals
have vanished into thin air, simply because a
widow has come into the game. There is
only one thing to do in such a case; retreat
gracefully, and leave the field to her.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Charm</div>

<p>A widow's degree of blandishment is conservatively
estimated at twenty-five spinster
power. At almost every session of spinsters,
the question comes up for discussion. It is
difficult to see just where the charm lies.</p>

<p>A widow has, of course, a superior knowledge
of ways and means. She has fully
learned the value of silence, of food, and of
judicious flattery. But these accomplishments
may be acquired by the observing spinster
who gives due attention to the subject.</p>

<p>The mystery lies deeper than is first suspected.
It is possible that the knowledge of
her own limitations has something to do with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
it. A girl who has been flattered, adored,
placed upon a pedestal and worshipped, naturally
comes to the conclusion that she belongs
there. She issues her commands from that
height and conveys to man various delicate
reminders of his servility.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Pedestal
Idea</div>

<p>When the same girl is married and by due
operation of natural law becomes a widow,
she doubtless has come to a better understanding
of the pedestal idea. Hence she does not
attempt the impossible, and satisfies herself
with working those miracles which are comparatively
simple.</p>

<p>A widow has all of the freedom of a girl,
combined with the liberty of a married woman.
She has the secure social position of a
matron without the drawback of a husband.
She is nearer absolute independence than other
women are ever known to be.</p>

<p>Where a girl is strong and self-reliant, a
widow is helpless and confiding. She can
never carry her own parcels, put on her own
overshoes, or button her own gloves. A
widow's shoe laces have never been known
to stay tied for any length of time, unless she
has shapeless ankles and expansive feet.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span></p>

<p>A widow's telegrams must always be taken
to the office by some man. Time-tables are
beyond her understanding and she never
knows about trains. It frequently takes three
or four men to launch a widow upon a two-hundred-mile
journey, while a girl can start
across the continent with considerably less
commotion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Inference</div>

<p>The inference is, of course, that she has
been accustomed to these delicate attentions&mdash;that
the dear departed has always done such
things. The pretty way in which she asks
favours carries out the delusion. He would
be a brute, indeed, who could refuse the little
service for which she pleads.</p>

<p>The dear departed, naturally, was delighted
to do these things, or he would not have done
them&mdash;such being the way of the married
man. Consequently, the lady was very tenderly
loved&mdash;and men follow each other like
sheep in matters of the heart.</p>

<p>The attraction a widower has for a girl is
in inverse proportion to a widow's influence
over a man. It is true that the second wife
is usually better treated than the first, and that
the new occupant of a man's heart reaps the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
benefit of her predecessor's training. But it
is not until spinsterhood is fully confirmed by
grey hair and the family Bible that a girl begins
to look with favour upon the army of
the detached.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Food
of her
Soul</div>

<p>It seems to her that all the romance is necessarily
gone&mdash;and it is romance upon which
her soul feeds. There can be none of that
dear delight in the first home building, which
is the most beautiful part of marriage to
a girl. Her pretty concern about draperies
and colours is all an old story to the man.
She may even have to buy her kitchen ware
all alone, and it is considered the nicest thing
in the world to have a man along when pots
and pans are bought.</p>

<p>If widowers and widows would only mate
with each other, instead of trespassing upon
the hunting grounds of the unmarried! It is
an exceptional case in which the bereaved are
not mutually wary. They seem to prefer the
unfair advantage gained by having all the experience
on one side.</p>

<p>The normal man proposes with ease and
carelessness, but the ceremony is second nature
to a widower. If he meets a girl he likes, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
proceeds at once to business and is slow indeed
for his kind if he does not offer his hand
and heart within a week.</p>

<p>A clever man once wrote a story, describing
the coming of a girl to a widower's house.
With care and forethought, the dying wife had
left a letter for her successor, which the man
fearlessly gave her before she had taken off her
hat, because, as the story-teller na&iuml;evely adds,
"she was twenty-eight and very sane."</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Nice
Letter</div>

<p>This letter proved to be various admonitions
to the bride and earnest hopes that she might
make her husband happy. It was all very
pretty and it was surely a nice letter, but no
woman could fail to see that it was an exquisite
revenge upon the man who had been rash
enough to install another in the place of the
dead.</p>

<p>There was not a line which was not kind, nor
a word which did not contain a hidden sting.
It would be enough to make one shudder all
one's life&mdash;this hand of welcome extended
from the grave. Yet everything continued
happily&mdash;perhaps because a man wrote the
story.</p>

<p>A woman demands not only all of a man's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
life, but all of his thoughts after she is dead.
The grave may hide much, but not that particular
quality in woman's nature. If it is
common to leave letters for succeeding wives,
it is done with sinister purpose.</p>

<p>Romance is usually considered an attribute
of youth, and possibly the years bring views
of marriage which are impossible to the
younger generation. No girl, in her wildest
moments, ever dreams of marrying a widower
with three or four children, yet, when she is
well on in her thirties, with her heart still unsatisfied,
she often does that very thing, and
happily at that.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Hidden
Heartache</div>

<p>Still, there must be a hidden heartache, for
woman, with her love of love, is unable to
understand the series of distinct and unrelated
episodes which make up the love of a man.
It is hard to take the crumbs another woman
has left, especially if a goodly portion of a
man's heart is suspected to lie in the grave.</p>

<p>It is harder still, if helpless children are
daily to look into her face, with eyes which
are neither hers nor his, and the supreme
crucifixion in the life of a woman whose
ideals have not changed, is to go into a home<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
which has been made by the hands of a dead
and dearly loved wife.</p>

<p>To a woman, material things are always
heavily laden with memories. There is not a
single article of furniture which has not its
own individuality. She cannot consider a
piece of embroidery apart from the dead hands
that made it, nor a chair without some association
with its previous occupants.</p>

<p>Sometimes the rooms are heavily laden with
portraits which are to confront her from day
to day with the taunting presence. She is
obliged to tell callers that the crayon upon the
opposite wall is "the first Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;." There
are also pictures of the first wife's dead children,
and here and there the inevitable photograph,
of years gone by, of bride and groom
in wedding garments&mdash;the man sitting down,
of course, while his wife stands behind him,
as a servant might, with her hand upon his
chair.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Day by
Day</div>

<p>Day by day, those eyes are fixed upon her
in stern judgment. Her failings and her conscious
virtues are forever before that other
woman. Her tears and her laughter are alike
subjected to that remorseless scrutiny.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">A Sheeted
Spectre</div>

<p>Does she dare to forget and be happy?
The other woman looks down upon her like
a sheeted spectre conveying a solemn warning.
"You may die," those pictured lips
seem to say, "and some other will take your
place, as you have taken mine." When the
tactlessness, bad temper, or general mulishness
of man wrings unwilling tears from her
eyes, there is no sympathy to be gained from
that impalpable presence. "You should not
have married him," the picture seems to say,
or; "He treated me the same way, and I
died."</p>

<p>She is not to be blamed if she fancies that
her husband also feels the presence of the
other. As she pours his coffee in the morning
and he looks upon her with the fond
glance which men bestow upon women
about to give them food, she may easily imagine
that he sees the other in her place.
Even the clasp of her hand or the touch of
her lips may bring a longing for that other,
hidden in the far-off grave.</p>

<p>Broadly speaking, widowers make better
husbands than widows do wives. The presence
of the dead wife may be a taunting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
memory, but seldom more. It is not often
that she is spoken of, unless it is to praise her
cooking. If she made incomparable biscuits
and her coffee was fit to be the nectar of the
gods, there are apt to be frequent and tactless
comparisons, until painful experience teaches
the sinner that this will not do.</p>

<div class="sidenote">"A Shining
Mark"</div>

<p>On the contrary, a widow's second husband
is often the most sincere mourner of her first.
As time goes on, he realises keenly what a
doleful day it was for him when that other
died. "Death loves a shining mark," and
that first husband was always such a paragon
of perfection that it seems like an inadvertence
because he was permitted to glorify this
sodden sphere at all. She keeps, in heart at
least, and often by outward observance, the
anniversaries of her former engagement and
marriage. The love letters of the dead are
put away with her jewels and bits of real lace.</p>

<p>Small defections are commented upon and
odious parallels drawn. Her home is seen to
be miserably inadequate beside the one she
once had. Her supply of pin money is
painfully small, judged by the standard which
has hitherto been her guide. Callers are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
entertained with anecdotes of "my first husband,"
and her dinner table is graced with the
same stories that famous raconteur was wont
to tell.</p>

<p>If her present husband pays her a compliment,
he is reminded that his predecessor was
accustomed to say the same thing. The relatives
of the first wife are gently made aware
that their acquaintance is not desired. His
manner of life is carefully renovated and his
old friendships put away with moth balls and
camphor, never to see the light again.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Best
Advertisement</div>

<p>Yet the best possible advertisement of matrimony
is the rapidity with which the bereaved
seek new mates. There is no more
delicate compliment to a first marriage than a
second alliance, even when divorce, rather
than death, has been the separating agency.
A divorced man has more power to charm
than a widower, because there is always the
supposition that he was not understood and
that his life's happiness is still to come.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Forgetting</div>

<p>Forgetting is the finest art of life and is to
be desired more than memory, even though
Mnemosyne stands close by Lethe and with
her dewy finger-tips soothes away all pain.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
The lowest life remembers; to the highest
only is it given to forget.</p>

<p>Yet, when the last word is said, this is the
dread and the pity of death. It is not "the
breathless darkness and the narrow house,"
but the certain knowledge that one's place
can almost instantly be filled. The lips that
quiver with sobs will some day smile again,
eyes dimmed by long weeping will dance with
laughter, hearts that once ached bitterly will
some day swell and overflow with a new love.</p>

<p>This knowledge lies heavily upon a woman's
soul and saddens, though often imperceptibly,
the happiest marriage. All her toil
and striving may some day be for naught.
The fruits of her industry and thrift may some
day gleam in jewels upon the white throat of
another woman. Silks and laces which she
could not have will add to the beauty of the
possible woman who will ascend her vacant
throne.</p>

<p>Sometimes a woman remains faithful to a
memory, and sometimes, though rarely, a
man may do the same. There is only one
relation in life which may not be formed
again&mdash;that between a mother and her child.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Child
Upon Her
Breast</div>

<p>The little one may have lived but a few
days, yet, if it has once lain upon her breast,
she has something Death may never hope to
destroy. Other children, equally dear, may
grow to stalwart manhood and gracious womanhood,
but that face rises to immortality
in a world of endless change.</p>

<p>No single cry, no weak clasp of baby
fingers is ever forgotten. Through all the
years, unchanging, and taking on new beauty
with every fleeting day, the little face is still
before her. And thus in a way Death brings
her a blessing, for when the others have
grown she has it still&mdash;the child upon her
breast.</p>

<p>Love's best gifts are not to be taken away.
Tender memories must always be inwoven
with the sad, and the sympathy and unselfishness
which great loves ever bring are left to
make sweet the nature of one who is chastened
by sorrow. Grief itself never stings;
it is the accusing conscience which turns the
dagger remorselessly in the heart.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Our unsuspected
Kindness</div>

<p>Life, after all, is a masquerade. We fear to
show our tenderness and our love. We
habitually hide our best feelings, lest we be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
judged weak and emotional, and unfit for the
age in which it is our privilege to move.
Sometimes it needs Death to show us ourselves
and to teach our friends our deep and
unsuspected kindness.</p>

<p>The woman who hungers throughout her
marriage for the daily expression of her husband's
love, often looks longingly towards
the day to come, when hot tears will fall
upon her upturned face and that for which
she has vainly thirsted will be laid upon her
silent lips. But swiftly upon the vision comes
the thought, that even so, it would be of
short duration; that the newly awakened
love would soon be the portion of someone
else.</p>

<p>It would be a beautiful world, indeed, if
we were not at such pains to hide our real
selves&mdash;if all our kindly thoughts were spoken
and all our generous deeds were done. No
one of us would think of Death as our best
friend, if we were not all so bitterly unkind.
Yet we put into white fingers the roses for
which the living might have pleaded in vain,
and too often, with streaming eyes, we ask
pardon of the dead.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Atonement</div>

<p>Atonement is not to be made thus. A
costly monument in a public square is tardy
appreciation of a genius whose generation refused
him bread. A man's tears upon a woman's
hands are not enough, when all her
life she has prayed for his love.</p>

<p>There is no law so unrelenting as that of
compensation. Gravitation itself may be more
successfully defied. It is the one thing which
is absolutely just and which is universal in its
action, though sometimes as slow as the majestic
forces which change rock to dust.</p>

<p>We cannot have more joy than we give&mdash;nor
more pain. The eternal balance swings
true. The capacity for enjoyment and the
capacity for suffering are one and the same.
He who lives out of reach of sorrow has sacrificed
his possible ecstasy. "He has seen only
half the universe who has not been shown the
House of Pain."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Emerson's
"Compensation"</div>

<p>"And yet the compensations of calamity
are made apparent to the understanding also
after long intervals of time. A fever, a
mutilation, a cruel disappointment, a loss of
friends, seems at the moment unpaid loss and
unpayable. But the sure years reveal the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
deep remedial force that underlies all facts.
The death of a dear friend, wife, brother,
lover, which seemed nothing but privation,
somewhat later assumes the aspect of a guide
or genius; for it commonly operates revolutions
in our way of life, terminating an epoch
of infancy or youth which was waiting to be
closed, breaks up a wonted occupation or a
household or style of living, and allows the
formation of new ones more friendly to the
growth of character. It permits or constrains
the formation of new acquaintances, and the reception
of new influences that prove of the
first importance to the next years; and the
man or woman who would have remained a
sunny garden flower, with no room for its
roots and too much sunshine for its head, by
the falling of the walls and the neglect of the
gardener is made the banian of the forest,
yielding shade and fruit to wide neighbourhoods
of men."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Upon the
Upland
Ways</div>

<p>That life alone is worth the living which
sets itself upon the upland ways. To steel
one's self against joy to be spared the inevitable
hurt, is not life. We are afraid of
love, because the might and terror of it has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
sometimes brought despair. We are afraid
of belief, because our trust has been betrayed.
We are afraid of death, because we have seen
forgetfulness.</p>

<p>We should not fear that someone might
take our place in the heart that loves us best&mdash;if
we were only loved enough. The same
love is never given twice; it differs in quality
if not in degree, and when once made one's
own, is never to be lost.</p>

<p>There are some natures whose happiness is
a matter of persons and things; some to
love and some to be loved; the daily needs
amply satisfied, and that is enough for content.</p>

<p>There are others with whom persons and
things do not suffice, whose love is vital, elemental,
and indestructible. It has no beginning
and no end; it simply is. With this
the Grey Angel has no power; the grave is
robbed of its victory and death of its sting.</p>

<p>"Love never denied Death and Death will
not deny Love." When the bond is of that
finer sort which does not rely upon presence
for its permanence, there is little bereavement
to be felt. For mutely, like a guardian angel,
that other may live with us still; not as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
a shadowy presence, but rather as a dear
reality.</p>

<p>That little mound of earth upon the distant
hill, over which the sun and stars pass in
endless sequence, and where the quiet is
unbroken through the change of spring to
autumn, and the change of autumn to spring,
has not the power to destroy love, but rather
to make it more sure.</p>

<p>The one who sleeps is forever beyond the
reach of doubt and misunderstanding. Separation,
estrangement, and bitterness, which
are sometimes concealed in the cup that Life
and Love have given, are forever taken out
by Death, who is never cruel and who is
often kind.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Wanderer's
Rest</div>

<p>We tread upon earth and revile it, forgetting
that at last it hides our defects and that
through it our dead hearts climb to blossom
in violets and rue. Death is the Wanderer's
Rest, where there is no questioning, but the
same healing sleep for all. In that divine
peace, there is no room for regret, since the
earthly loves are sure of immortality.</p>

<div class="sidenote">While the
Dream
Seemed
True</div>

<p>As much as is vital will live on, unchanging,
changeless, and taking on new sweet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>ness
with the years. That which is not
wholly given, which is ours only for a little
time, will fade as surely as the roses in the
marble hands. Death has saved many a heartache,
by coming while the dream still seemed
true.</p>

<p>In a single passage, Emerson has voiced
the undying beauty and the everlasting truth
which lie beneath the perplexities of life.</p>

<p>"Oh, believe as thou livest, that every
sound which is spoken over the round world,
which thou oughtest to hear, will vibrate on
thine ear. Every proverb, every book, every
byword which belongs to thee for aid or comfort,
shall surely come home, through open or
winding passages. Every friend, whom not
thy fantastic will, but the great and tender
heart in thee craveth, shall lock thee in his
embrace. And this, because the heart in thee
is the heart of all; not a valve, not a wall,
not an intersection is there anywhere in nature,
but one blood rolls uninterruptedly an
endless circulation through all men, as the
water of the globe is all one sea, and, truly
seen, its tide is one."</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Everlasting
Love</div>

<p>Sometimes, into two hearts great enough to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
hold it, and into two souls where it may forever
abide, there comes the Everlasting Love.
It is elemental, like fire and the sea, with
the depth and splendour of the surge and
the glory of the flame. It makes the world a
vast cathedral, in which they two may worship,
and where, even in the darkness, there
is the peace which passeth all understanding,
because it is of God.</p>

<p>When the time of parting comes, for there
is always that turning in the road, the sadness
is not so great because one must go on alone.
Life grows beautiful after a time and even
wholly sweet, when a man and a woman
have so lived and loved and worked together,
that death is not good-bye, but rather&mdash;"auf

<h2 style="color: red;">The Consolations of Spinsterhood</h2>


<div class="sidenote">"A Great
Miration"</div>

<p>The attached members of the community
are wont to make what Uncle Remus
called "a great miration," when a woman
deliberately chooses spinsterhood as her lot in
life, rather than marriage.</p>

<p>There is an implied pity in their delicate
inquiries, and always the insinuation that the
spinster in question could never have had an
offer of marriage. The husband of the lady
leading the inquisition may have been one of
the spinster's first admirers, but it is never
safe to say so, for so simple a thing as this
has been known to cause trouble in families.</p>

<p>If it is known positively that some man has
offered her his name and his troubles, and
there is still no solitaire to be seen, the logical
hypothesis is charitably advanced, that she has
been "disappointed in love." It is possible
for a spinster to be disappointed in lovers, but
only the married are ever disappointed in love.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">A Cause
of Stagnation</div>

<p>The married women who ask the questions
and who, with gracious kindness, hunt up attractive
men for the unfortunate young woman
to meet, are, all unknowingly, one great
cause of stagnation in the marriage-license
market.</p>

<p>Nothing so pleases a woman safely inside
the bonds of holy matrimony as to confide
her sorrows, her regrets, and her broken
ideals to her unattached friends. Many a
woman thinks her ideal is broken when it is
only sprained, but the effect is the same.</p>

<p>Was the coffee weak and were the waffles
cold, and did Monsieur express his opinion of
such a breakfast in language more concise
than elegant? Madame weeps, and gives a
lurid account of the event to the visiting
spinster. By any chance, does a girl go
from her own dainty and orderly room into
an apartment strewn with masculine belongings,
confounded upon confusion such as
Milton never dreamed? Does she have to
wait while her friend restores order to the
chaos? If so, she puts it down in her mental
note-book, upon the page headed "Against."</p>

<p>The small domestic irritations which crowd<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
upon the attached woman from day to day,
leaving crow's feet around her eyes and delicate
tracery in her forehead, have a certain
effect upon the observing. But worse than
this is the spectre of "the other woman,"
which haunts her friend from day to day, to
the grave&mdash;and after, if the dead could tell
their thoughts.</p>

<p>If she has been safely shielded from books
which were not written for The Young Person,
Mademoiselle believes that marriage is a
bond which is not to be broken except by
death. It is a severe shock when she first
discovers that death changes nothing; that it
is only life which separates utterly.</p>

<div class="sidenote">That
Pitiful
Story</div>

<p>That pitiful story of "the other woman"
comes from quarters which the uninitiated
would never suspect. With grim loyalty,
married women hide their hearts from each
other. Many a smile conceals a tortured soul.
When the burden is no longer to be borne, a
spinster is asked to share it.</p>

<p>A woman will forgive a man anything except
disloyalty to herself. Crimes which the
law stands ready to punish rank as naught
with her, if the love between them is untarn<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>ished
by doubt or mistrust. Any offence
prompted by her own charm, even a duel to
the death with a rival suitor, is easily condoned.
But though God may be able to forgive
disloyalty, in her heart of hearts no
woman ever can.</p>

<div class="sidenote">An Idle
Flirtation</div>

<p>More often than not, it is simply an idle flirtation,
or, at the most, a passing fancy which the
next week may prove transient and unreal.
The woman with the heartache will say, with
wet eyes and quivering lips: "I know, positively,
that my husband has done nothing
wrong. I would go to the stake upon that belief.
He is only weak and foolish and a little
vain, perhaps, and some day he will see his
mistake, but I cannot bear to see him compromise
himself and me in the eyes of the world.
Of course, <i>I</i> know," she will say, proudly,
"but there are others who do not,&mdash;who are
always ready to suspect,&mdash;and I will not have
them pity me!"</p>

<p>When nearly all the married friends a spinster
has have come to her with the same
story, the variations being individual and of
slight moment, she begins to have serious
doubts of matrimony as a satisfactory career.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
Women who have been married five, ten, and
even twenty years; women with children
grown and whom the world counts safely and
happily married, will sob bitterly in the embrace
of the chosen girl friend.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Indifference</div>

<p>Indifference is the only counsel one has to
offer, but even so, it gradually becomes the
first of the steppes upon the heart-way which
lead to an emotional Siberia.</p>

<p>Of course there are women who are insanely
jealous of their husbands, and, more rarely,
men who are jealous of their wives. Jealousy
may be explained as innate vanity and selfishness
or as a defect in temperament, but at any
rate, it is a condition which is far past the
theoretical stage.</p>

<p>It is hard for a spinster to understand why
any woman should wish to hold a man against
his will. A dog who has to be kept chained,
in order to be retained as a pet, is never a very
satisfactory possession. It seems natural to
apply the same reasoning to human affairs,
for surely no love is worth having which is
not a free gift.</p>

<p>No girl would feel particularly flattered by a
proposal, if it were put in this form: "Will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
you marry me? No one else will." Yet the
same girl, married, would gladly take her
husband to a desert island, that she might be
sure of him forever.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Behind
Prison
Bars</div>

<p>Love which needs to be put behind prison
bars, that it may not escape, is not love, but
attraction, fascination, or whatever the psychologists
may please. A man chooses his
wife, not because there are no other women,
but in spite of them. It is a pathetic acknowledgment
of his poor judgment, if he lets the
world suspect that his choice was wrong.</p>

<p>There are some souls that hie them faraway
from civilisation, to convents, monasteries, and
western plains, that they may keep away from
temptation. In the same fashion, woman tries
to isolate her lord and master. If he meets
women at all, they are those invisibly labeled
"not dangerous."</p>

<p>The world makes as many saints as sinners,
and the man who needs to be kept away from
any sort of temptation is weak indeed. There
are many of his kind, but he is the better man
in the end who meets it face to face, fights
with it like a soldier, and wins like a king.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Thousand
Foes</div>

<p>The mother of Sparta bade her son return<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
with his shield or on it, and the thought has
potential might to-day. If a man honestly
loves a woman, she need have no fear of the
thousand foes that wait to take him from her.
If he does not, the sooner she understands the
truth, the better it is for both. There are
many people who consider love a dream, but
they usually grow to think of marriage as the
cold breakfast.</p>

<p>Men are but children of a larger growth. A
small boy forgets his promise to stay at home
and tears madly down the street in the discordant
wake of a band. The same boy, in
later years, will follow his impulses with equal
readiness, for he is taught conformity to outward
laws, but very seldom self-control.</p>

<p>The fear of "the other woman" may be
largely assuaged by a spinster's confidence in
her ability to cope with the difficult situation,
should it ever present itself, but there are other
considerations which act as a discouragement
to matrimony.</p>

<p>The chains of love may be sweet bondage,
but freedom is hardly less dear. The spinster,
like the wind, may go where she listeth, and
there is no one to say her nay. A modern<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
essayist has pointed out that "if a mortal
knows his mate cannot get away, he is apt to
be severe and unreasonable."</p>

<p>The thought of being compelled to ask for
money, and perhaps to meet with refusal,
frequently acts as a deterrent upon incipient
love. A man is often generous with his
sweetheart and miserly with his wife. In the
days of courtship, the dollars may fly on wings
in search of pleasure for the well-beloved, and
yet, after marriage, they will be squeezed until
the milling is worn smooth, the eyes start
from the eagle, and until one half-way expects
to hear the noble bird scream.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Unlimited
Credit</div>

<p>There are girls in every circle, married to
men not by any means insolvent, who have
unlimited credit, but never any money of their
own. They have carriages but no car fare;
fine stationery, monogrammed and blazoned
with a coat of arms, but not by any chance a
postage stamp.</p>

<p>Many a woman in such circumstances covenants
with the tradespeople to charge as merchandise
what is really cash, and sells laces
and ribbons to her friends a little below cost.
When a girl is approached with a plea to have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
her purchases charged to her friend's account,
and to pay her friend rather than the merchant,
is it not sufficient to postpone possible
matrimony at least six months? Adversity
has no terrors for a woman; she will gladly
share misfortune with the man she loves, but
simple selfishness is a very different proposition.</p>

<div class="sidenote">"Wedded
to their
Art"</div>

<p>There are also the dazzling allurements
offered by various "careers" which bring
fame and perhaps fortune. The glittering
triumphs of a prima donna, a picture on the
line in the Salon, or a possible book which
shall sell into the hundred thousands, are not
without a certain charm, even though people
who are "wedded to their art" sometimes
get a divorce without asking for it.</p>

<p>The universal testimony of the great, that
fame itself is barren, is thrust aside as of small
moment. She does not realise that it is love
for which she hungers, rather than fame, which
is the admiration of the many. Sometimes
she learns that "the love of all is but a small
thing to the love of one" and that in a right
marriage there would be no conscious sacrifice.
If she were not free to continue the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
work that she loved, she would feel no
deprivation.</p>

<p>Happiness is often thrust aside because of
her ideals. She demands all things in a single
man, forgetting that she, too, is human and not
by any means faultless. Some day, perhaps
too late, she understands that love and criticism
lie far apart, that love brings beauty
with it, and that the marks of individuality
are the very texture of charm, as the splendour
of the opal lies in its flaws.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Vital
Touch</div>

<p>There is always the doubt as to whether
the seeker may be the one of all the world to
find the inmost places in her heart. Taste and
temperament may be akin, position and purpose
in full accord, and yet the vital touch may
be lacking. Sometimes, in the after-years, it
may be found by two who seek for it patiently
together, but too often dissonance grows into
discord and estrangement.</p>

<p>The march of civilisation has done away
with the odium which was formerly the portion
of the unattached woman. It is no disgrace
to be a spinster, and apparently it is
fitting and proper to be an old maid, since so
many of them have "Mrs." on their cards, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
since there are so many narrow-minded and
critical men who fully deserve the appellation.</p>

<p>There is no use in saying that any particular
girl is a spinster from necessity rather than
choice. One has but to look at the peculiar
specimens of womankind who have married,
to be certain that there is no one on the wide
earth who could not do so if she chose.</p>

<div class="sidenote">"A Discipline"</div>

<p>Some people are fond of alluding to marriage
as "a discipline," and sometimes a
grey-haired matron will volunteer the information
that "the first years of marriage are anything
but happy." To one who has hitherto
regarded it from a different point of view,
the training-school idea is not altogether
attractive.</p>

<p>Men and women who have been through
it very seldom hold to their first opinions. It
is considered as a business arrangement, a
social contrivance, sometimes as an easy way
to make money, but by very few as the highest
form of happiness.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Small
Extravagances</div>

<p>The consolations of spinsterhood are mainly
negative, but the minus sign has its proper
place in the personal equation. "The other
woman" does not exist for the spinster, save<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
as a shadowy possibility. She is not asked
what she did with the nickel which was
given her day before yesterday, and thus
forced to make confession of small extravagances,
or to reply, with such sweetness as
she may muster, that she bought a lot on a
fashionable street with part of it, and has
the remainder out at interest. She does not
have to stay at home from social affairs
because she has no escort, for the law has
not apportioned to her a solitary man, and
she has a liberty of choice which is not
accorded her married friend.</p>

<p>She is not subjected to the humiliation of
asking a man for money to pay for his own
food, his own service, and even his own
laundry bill. She can usually earn her own,
if the gods have not awarded her sufficient
gold, and there is no money which a woman
spends so happily as that which she has
earned herself.</p>

<p>The "career" lies before her, and she has
only to choose the thing for which she is
best fitted, and work her way upward from
the lowest ranks to the position of a star
of the first magnitude. Opportunity is but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
another name for health, obstacles make firm
stepping-stones, and that which is dearly
bought is by far the sweetest in the end.
Of course there are "strings to pull," but
no one needs them. Success is more lasting
if it is won in an open field, without favour,
and in spite of generous measures of it bestowed
upon the opposition.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Greatest
Consolation</div>

<p>But of all the consolations of spinsterhood,
the greatest is this,&mdash;that out of the dim and
uncertain future, perchance in the guise of
a divorced man or a widower with four
children, The Prince may yet come.</p>

<p>"On his plain but trusty sword are these
words only&mdash;Love and Understand." Across
the unsounded, estranging seas, with a whole
world lying immutably between, he, too, may
be waiting for the revelation. He may come
as a knight of old, with banners, jewels, and
flashing steel, to the clarion ring of trumpet
or cymbal, or softly, in the twilight, like
one whose presence is felt before it is made
known.</p>

<p>Out of the city streets The Prince may
come, tired of the endless struggle, when the
tide of the human has beaten heavily upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
his jaded soul, or through the woods, with
the silence of the forest still upon him. His
path may lie through an old garden, where
marigold and larkspur are thickly interwoven,
and shadowy spikes of mignonette make all
the summer sweet, or through the frosty
darkness, when the earth is dumb with snow
and the midnight stars have set the heavens
ablaze with spires of sapphire light.</p>

<div class="sidenote">At the
First
Meeting</div>

<p>Sometimes, at the first meeting The Prince
is known, by that mysterious alchemy which
lies in the depths of the maiden soul and
often, after long waiting, a friend throws off
his disguise and royalty stands revealed.
Sometimes he is the comrade of the far-off
childish years, the schoolmate of a later time,
or someone whose hand has proved a strength
and solace in times of deepest grief.</p>

<p>"To Love and Understand!" All else
may be forgiven, if he has but these two gifts,
for they are as the crest and royal robe. Bare
and empty his hands may be, but these are
the kingly rights.</p>

<p>Slowly, and sometimes with a strange fear
which makes her tremble, there steals into
her heart a great peace. With it comes in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>finite
tenderness and an unspeakable compassion,
not only for him, but for all the world.
Love's laughter changes to questioning too
deep for smiles or tears&mdash;the boundless aspiration
of the soul toward all things true.</p>

<p>Playthings and tinsel are cast away. The
music of the dance dies in lingering, discordant
fragments, and in its place comes the full
tone of an organ and the majestic movement
of a symphony. The web of the daily living
grows beautiful in the new light, for the Hand
that set the pattern has been gently laid upon
her loom.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Through
all the
Years to
Come</div>

<p>Through all the years to come, they are to
be together; he and she. There will be no
terror in the wilderness, no sting in poverty
or defeat&mdash;hunger and thirst can be forgotten.
Wherever Destiny may point the way, they
are to fare together&mdash;he and she.</p>

<p>Somewhere, in a world whose only shame
is its uncleanliness, they two are to make a
home and keep the little space around them
wholly clean. Somewhere, they two will
show the world that the old ideals are not
lost; that a man and a woman may still live
together in supreme and lasting content.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
Somewhere, too, they will teach anew the old
lesson, that it is unyielding Honour at the core
of things that keeps them sound and sweet.</p>

<p>There is nothing in all life so beautiful as
that first dream of Home; a place where
there is balm for the tortured soul, new courage
for the wavering soul, rest for the tired
soul, and stronger trust for the soul caught
in the snares of doubt and disbelief&mdash;a place
where one may be wholly and joyfully one's
self, where one's mistakes are never faults,
where pardon ever anticipates the asking,
where love follows swiftly upon understanding
and understanding upon love.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Sceptre of
the King</div>

<p>"To Love and Understand!" He who
holds the sceptre of the king may rule right
royally. There is solace for the tired traveller
within the cloister of that other heart, and the
pitiful chains which some call marriage would
rust and decay at the entrance to that holy
place.</p>

<p>The spotless peace within the inner chamber
is his alone. There his motives are never
questioned, nor his words distorted beyond
their meaning, and his daily purposes are ever
read aright.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span></p>

<p>The dream is forever centred upon the
coming of The Prince. Sometimes, with the
grim irony of Fate, he is seen when both are
bound&mdash;and there are some who deem a heartache
too great a price to pay for the revelation.
Now and then, after many years, he comes to
claim his own.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Grey
Angel and
the Prince</div>

<p>And sometimes, too, when one has long
waited and prayed for his coming; when
the sight has grown dim with watching and the
frosty rime of winter has softly touched the
dark hair, the Grey Angel takes pity and
closes the tired eyes.</p>

<p>The lavender and the dead rose-leaves
breathe a hushed fragrance from the heaps
of long-stored linen; the cricket and the tiny
clock keep up their cheery song, because they
do not know their gentle mistress can no
longer hear. The slanting sunbeams of afternoon
mark out a delicate tracery upon the
floor, and the shadow of the rose-geranium
in the window is silhouetted upon the opposite
wall. And then, into the quiet house,
steals something which seems like an infinite
calm.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Exquisite
Peace</div>

<p>But the dainty little lady who lies fast<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
asleep, with the sun resting caressingly upon
her, has gained, in that mystical moment,
both understanding and love. For there comes
an exquisite peace upon her&mdash;as though she
had found The Prince.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
